 my school was named after anne frank and we had a club that i was very active in from 9th grade on.<n>basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games.<n>i was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders.<n>we start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about anne frank and the third reich?
 after my mom died from cancer last year, i started looking for my estranged father .<n>i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name .<n>he told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me .<n>i don't want to hurt him, but i just can't trust him .
 i tried this before and the results were great but i had decided to do it again because of how well it worked.<n>the slight peroxide kinda smell ensued and all was going well, there was a slight burning but thats to be expected, you know, melting pubes off does that.<n>but, the danglies were what was burning, i scraped them and withstood the pain because well lets face it, men are men and a little pain for balls as smooth as jam jars is fine right?<n>wrong, it did great at taking the hair off it, but decided to take the first layer of skin too,
 After painting kids faces at a carnival, i was going to have a bath .<n>i put in some epsom salts (i always do for my bath), and i grabbed my bottle of peppermint essential oil .<n>the other day i took a 'detox bath' (fyi did nothing for me guys)
 i haven't had a bath in practically years so, after finally moving into a house with a bath, i decide to have one.<n>Having recently purchased a shiny new bag of weed, i thought combining the two would be a good idea.<n> picture this; a very cramped bathroom, no windows, a shitty extractor fan, closed door, steaming hot bath and a spliff.
 on my way i saw landscape workers working around the houses and cleaning.<n>i meet my gf and go find a spot in the woods. the spot we went to seemed nice and lonely for the both of us to hang out.<n>We were having sex peacefully until we heard workers. they sounded far but every second they seemed to get closer.<n>We realized that they were just a few feet away.<n> quickly me and my gf got up and get dressed and head over to a different spot which was not a good idea.
 i'm out of cooking oil, but want some french fries .<n>i search the internet and find that if you cover french fries with something, either napkins or another plate and microwave them, they turn out ok .<n>i tried it, i took to plates, smushed em together and put the french fries in the microwave. (don't try this at home)<n>i was poking around the fries when my finger squishes into a really soft one, right into the hell-fire center .<n>i put aloe vera on the end of my finger and it feels like little tiny snow angels
 after hanging out with a friend of mine, we decide to visit another friend at her house since we're nearby .<n>i pull up the driveway, see other friends' truck in the way, so i try to go around .<n>i get out, lo and behold i'm stuck. if my truck had 4 wheel drive, i wouldn't have been as concerned .<n>i dodge the truck, which hits the girl's barn. neither the barn nor the truck was hurt, but i was pinned between the truck and the barbed wire fence on the passenger side .
 when i reached down to scratch her, she tolerated it for about 10-15 seconds .<n>after i got my hand loose, about ten seconds after the initial hit, it was already turning purple with a huge blood pool underneath my middle finger nail .<n>my other finger nails felt like i had played that stupid bite down on them as hard as you can, then push your fingers together game .
 i was sitting in the cafeteria at my college when i felt a particularly big cough coming on. it was a very effective cough, and apparently too effective, because instantly i realized i had shat my pants.
 it actually didn't happen today but about 5 years ago.<n>i was still a virgin and kind of frustrated about it.<n>you know how it goes \shit i'm still a virgin...\<n>i heard that there was a girl which i heard she was pretty easy(let's call her easy girl from now on)
 my boss had a stroke. he was hospitalized today.<n>While a coworker was explaining his status i had my ear buds in and was hysterically laughing like a hyena at adviceanimals.
 this happened this last weekend we all know that \i'm glad you came\ song right?<n> yeah i now will forever hate that song let me rewind i am 22 years old and in college my mom and sister came to pick me up for the weekend because my car is at the shop well anyways that song comes on my sister starts singing it .<n>The idiot would be the one to say \thats what your mom said last night' she immediatley smacked me and the mouth pretended and nothing even happened .
 i left my keys on the counter and locked the door on the way out. it was both my car keys and my condo keys and i had no way back in.<n>my wife had left for work 5 minutes earlier; i tried calling her and she didn't answer. so i decided to walk...not three steps down the stairs i felt a fart coming on.<n>i let it out slowly because i haven't been feeling great lately, and i felt a wet juicy fart slip out of my cheeks, only it wasn't just a fart it was diarrhea.
 girl in my class and i have been working on a number of projects lately .<n>there seems to have been a number of signals, her calling things \our song,\ texts for no reason, etc .<n>the only problem was that i was her group leader (she was working under me) and i felt it inapropriate to make my move while that was still the case .<n>friends come over, i get wasted....wake up the next morning with a different girl in my bed and her ignoring my calls .
 i've never sat in that friend's lap again .<n> driving in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap was never on my bucket list .<n>after a month, with crutches, a knee brace and some really pleasant taping, physiotherapy and an inability to climb stairs easily, my knee was finally released from its self-induced prison .
 i brought my laptop to school to hook up to one of the extra hard drives while i had decided to reinstall. so get to school and whats the first thing my dumbass self does?<n>put the installation disc in and format the whole hard drive without backing up. so now i have lost all my videos, half finished projects, notes and school work.
 i woke up extremely tired, looking for a way to wake my self up .<n> poured some cereal into a bowl and got a cup, got out the milk and juice, and poured the milk into the cup and the juice on the cereal .<n> noticed the odd taste, and actually liked it.
 he lives 200 miles away from where i live, but my life's rather busy and he doesn't have a job right now .<n>there's a huge secessionist movement within a different region .<n>i am a lover of said region; it's the place where i feel the most comfortable in the entire world .
 i took the speaker with the intact audio output, plugged it into my phone, hooked up the speaker to the voltage oscillator, kicked it up to five volts, and started playing a song on my phone.<n>little did i know that the current would travel through the speaker, up the auxiliary cable, into my phone's battery where the battery beyond had a maximum load capacity of only three point eight volts.
 i seldom go to starbucks but today i decided i should go, well inner me decides, \hey! lets get a frappucino!\<n>i'm lactose intolerant and coffee usually upsets my stomach, but hey i really wanted to go to try the new hazelnut frappe and this totally escaped my mind.
 one day, i had to help share a file between my computer and my brother's .<n>my phone uploads the recent backup of my texts, and my brother sees it .<n>Since it had a weird file name, he opened it to make sure it wasn't some virus .
 after telling him a few times to slow down because it hurt, he switched back to good old vaginal intercourse from behind .<n>He was still going in from behind, so i decided to stick my butt up and arch my back down because it drives him insane .<n>he was still going in from behind, so i decided to stick my butt up and arch my back down because it drives him insane .
 i was going downstairs about 2 hours ago to get something to eat and possibly to drink .<n>while downstairs i notice my mother eating a salad, and naturally i was like fuck yea salad i love me some salad.<n>my step-dad rolls in the kitchen and tries to pull off his version of the heimlich maneuver as well which also wasn't pretty at all.<n>my wife comes down the stairs and she starts freaking out and calls the ambulance and i realize why she was shocked as i saw the puddle of blood coming from my mothers mouth.<n>my step-dad left shortly after and i havn
 i was working at a fast food restaurant working the grill. it was a particularly busy day, and i didn't have a lot of experience on the grill.<n>Now cathy has burns on about 90% of her body which is very unfortunate, but cathy is also a huge bitch.<n>i immediately feel the daggers of empathy go through my heart, and try to apologize, but the damage is done and i realize that everyone around me is just staring.
 After much pleading with my girlfriend i was able to convince her to have special sexy times .<n>Not only that, but i was going to, for lack of something clever, cum right on her neck, which sounds fantastic and foolproof!<n>So we are going at it, i'm making sweet sweet glorious love to her sweet sweet boobs.<n>i start to get some tingles and jingles brewing downstairs and i get ready for what i expect to be a wonderful and simple ejaculation.<n>but, it took this mysterious angle. and it was as if time slowed down so as to allow me
 my map app told me that it was a toll road so i pulled out $20 cash thinking it would be plenty .<n> turns out it doesn't even matter because i get in the wrong lane and end up being forced through the ez pass .<n>i have taken cross country road trips alone with 4 kids since they were babies and have never once felt as stupid and incapable as i did then .
 i'm not an expert on windows 8 by any means, but i thought i would at least give him a brief tutorial just to help him out .<n>this guy was bounced from line to line and no one was willing to help him, so why wouldn't i make his day just a bit better by doing him this one favor?<n>lucky me i guess, half those tabs were porn. straight up porn. my favorite had to have been the \daddy daughter massage play\
 Last week, the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual, because i had to buy some groceries on my apartment that i didn t account for .<n>Now, i dont have a debit card so i can t get money from my savings that easily.<n>So naturally i don't tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and i try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money .<n>By friday morning i had only enough money to return to my apartment and thats it.<n>As i was pretty much bankrupt and i had
 last 20 seconds and im tied with my friend who is sitting there split screening with me.<n>i win by a kill. herrs where i fuck up.<n>i get so excited and all of us are cheering that i kick the xbox over.<n>it makes a weird humming noise and we wait like 10 seconds before unplugging it.<n>he pops out the disc, and shit, its scratched. its now unreadable.
 my friend, brother and i went to go watch a movie at a local theatre.<n>Im getting over a stomach flu so ive been passing gas lately, sorry for the tmi. so we find a parking spot and i thought it would be funny to rip a huge one before we leave to see if the smell would still stay in the truck until after the movie, i really didnt need to so i tried to force one out! and boom... a big ass shart!!!
 because my nails are super thick and i have scissors instead of clippers, i tend to forget clipping them every now and then .<n>i stumbled down the mini-steps into the hallway, sending my right big toe smashing into the back of my left foot .<n>Turns out my nail was so long, the leverage from the impact cracked it in half horizontally, and sent the sharp interior edge down into the nail bed .
 i received a call from the attractive woman that i had been texting the previous day and i looked at the number thinking \oh god, what have i done?!\ soon, i scrolled through my text messages realizing that i was texting an obese, not so attractive male associate of mine.
 we got a bit hungry around 1-ish today and decided to get something we haven't eaten in a while.<n>i offered my dad to buy him lunch and he said taco bell. i was hesitant because i never really eat there (i'm not big on taco bell, sue me)<n>my dad reassured me that the loaded grillers they now serve we're great so i took is word, got my friend, my dad and myself a bunch of shit and had a nice lunch.
 not paying attention, i pressed where the play button usually is. instead of hitting play, i bring up my tumblr (where i have my porn)<n> suddenly, my screen is filled with bear (big hairy men, not the animal) cock.<n>i panicked and closed the app and tried explaining that my friend was messing with me sending various pictures. she played it off, but i'm not sure she bought it.
 we're friends, have been for a while. so i'm thinking i'll go here for lunch. she's working, and i starting talking to her, hitting on her, cuz she's hot and i'm a guy so fuck it, why not.<n> turns out, when i dated her friend a while back, and dumped her after a week (bitches be cray), she didn't like it. also turns out, we aren't friends. and she hates me.
 juan's previous two attempts to block him from getting to my lane and stop pulling that fuckery failed .<n>Fortunately, the guy driving it was cool and only wanted $50 for the broken mirror on his car .<n>He didn't seem like a dick (and also might not be a resident/citizen; he wasn't a high roller from the looks of his car and clothes)
 i work as sales in a manufacturing/distributing company that sells paper and plastic products.<n>a distributor contacts me and is interested in spoons, requests prices, i give, and then orders.<n>he gives me a card over email, which i should've suspected, but i didn't since it was a large amount of $$ and i'm based on commission.
 i wanted to apply to both because theres a prestigious animation program at a college 1 city away from here where many of pixar, disney and other industry giants employees are recruited from.<n>the only thing holding me back was the 95$ fee to apply.<n>i tried to pay for it myself because i knew i'd have no support from my parents - but my card was declined each time i tried and my mom said i should \think about it more before i apply\ all while speaking in a saddened/angered tone.
 i had asked if her sister was single and whatnot, i pretty much just asked that in general because i thought my sister and hers where not friends anymore, i tried to say my bad and apologize but it was busy.<n>though as i left she said in a joking way from what i could tell that she was going to tell her.
 i have a tendency to get really, really bored at work - because we have long periods of downtime.<n>to keep myself awake i try to make myself physically uncomfortable.<n>on my way in yesterday morning, i knew i had to drop a deuce, so i figured i'd hold it til after work to get me through the day. it didn't help.<n>a minute later my boss nudges my arm and tells me to go home and get some sleep - i had fallen asleep watching the clock. so on the drive home, i'm annoyed at myself.<n>as i pull off the highway i
 Headsooth is a chapstick like device which you apply to your forehead when you have a headache .<n>It gives a deep cold/burning sensation which isn't pleasant and the best of times .
 my first class had been canceled, and i was running late for my other class.<n>we were having a test in that class, so i wanted to get there on time. best way? to drive fast. keep in mind, i drive a 97 ford with a little 4 cylinder engine.<n>didn't see the cop just off the road. then, to top it off, i didn't have current insurance cards.
 i had lost my old lock but i had the one from my locker at my last job so i just brought that with me.<n>when i get done with my workout, i go back in the locker room, grab my soap, a towel, and underwear, lock my locker and go shower.<n>there i stood, wet, cold, and in my boxers, staring at my locker and the empty locker room and contemplating my next move.<n>the entire gym is one big room, with mirrors around the perimeter. if you're in the gym, people can see you. it was late, but not late enough that
 i did some nude photography/modeling a few years back .<n>While i love the pieces i did and do not regret them in the slightest, i don't particularly want seeing my friends, especially male friends, seeing me nude .
 i think it's a combination of pms (which makes me want to have a dick inside me in the worst way) and just thinking about the incredible sex i had this past weekend .<n>well, my boss was in a meeting all day today so i let the horny-ness get the best of me .<n>my 68-year old boss turned on by my masturbation/orgasm. he then went into the bathroom for a few minutes, and we haven't exchanged words since the incident .
 i am sitting in one of the new chairs when i feel a little sture of nature encroaching upon my stink wrinkles .<n>i think, \ok cool, done this a million times, just push it up and let it out easy and no harm done\ but oh no, **ohhhh no** instead of the dainty lady like poot i was expecting .<n>the entire room fell completely and utterly quite as the loudest noise came from my anus, followed by a river of soupy shit .
 I had never been sick from alcohol until the first night .<n>One mate nailed the grimmest effort of a girl in our whole resort .<n>Saw an ambulance pulling up. woke up in the middle of the night on a drip .
 today i had two exam finals and a paper final due tomorrow. then i would be done or, so i thought.<n>i get to my 1:30pm final and begin talking to the guy who sits next to me...who just happens to be in my class with the paper final i thought was due tomorrow.<n>some friends of mine come in and as we're talking i let it slip i have a paper i need to write for tomorrow. the guy i was talking to before interjects and with a look of pity informs me that our paper final was due today.<n>i immidately panic and type out an email
 my grandmother is not an avid user of the internet, but i am.<n>i implored her to change to a shaped plan. a shaped plan is where instead of charging you extra when you go over your data allowance, they slow your throughput with no further charges. she refused.<n>i consistently went over our data allowance with pornography every single month that i lived with my grandmother.
 The dildo fell out of use and i became accustomed to the sound of it rolling around in the trunk .<n>Eventually, i got tired of explaining the story of the dildo to people and threw it in a messenger bag that remained in my trunk .<n>i searched and searched and could not find the dildo. there can only be one explanation. and my dad hasn't said anything. and i'll never say anything either. but until the day he dies, my father will know that his son, at one point in time, owned a sixteen inch double ended floppy black dildo
 i made a promise to z not to tell anyone what happened and as you will soon understand, it is safer if it just stays hidden.<n>a few weeks ago i got a call from a particularly drunken and high z who wanted to do themselves in so i spent that night making sure they were okay.<n>after that night, everything was perfectly fine until 3 weeks later when this sentence was said \i will always appreciate you. you are one of the best people i know... i fucking hate you! you are a prick. i hope you die!\ and they ran off.<n>over the next few days people started learning
 i went on a 2nd date with a girl from okcupid. originally we planned to go snowtubing but the snow had melt. instead she invites me over for dinner.<n>i end up diving head first down a 6 foot drop.<n>unfortunately i break both of them, cracking the wall and causing a giant banging sound.
 i was in the midst of the toughest 2 years anyone has gone through .<n>i got so scared of my own shadow, constantly afraid of saying the wrong thing that might add more stress to her life, that i barely said anything .<n>she needed to rip off some band aids to take back control of her own life, and i was one of those band aids .
 elderflower soda sprayed everything in an even greater radius than before .<n>i realized i reversed the process of making this damn soda.<n>i spend the next 15 minutes wiping down the kitchen, while my stepmom was laughing at me .
 My roommate changed the name of my USB stick on his mac, which for whatever reason wasn't visible on pc.<n>My professor made me tell the story the next class, and that's what i am currently known for within my major as far as i know.
 apparently she saw my penis and muttered, \oh my..\ and kinda walked away into her room without saying anything else.<n>i didn't know anything until my girlfriend told me after that her mom saw half of my penis.
 one of my co-workers knows her family and we were talking about her before her shift one day. turns out this girl is from a wealthy family, is extremely popular, all the normal things that makes me regress into my old angsty \i hate pretty girls\ mentality.<n> one day during a lull we start talking about our families (just basic 'do you have any brothers or sisters?' kind of stuff) she starts talking about her brothers and how they don't get along.<n>i share my experience with my family and tell her 'you know, things may seem bad now but when you get older and
 7 cars sped out of the parking lot in formation. my friend got instantly excited and followed. we thought we were going to see some fucked up shit.<n>we even followed them into the next town. they eventually parked in a sketchy area. when we parked, we saw them all get out and they were only a large latino family. biggest disappointment ever.
 epiduo is an overpriced version of neutrogena .<n>It says not to mix with other medications, and to be careful of using it while in sunlight .
 My boyfriend, \j\, lives in an a one bedroom apartment with a currently unemployed roommate .<n>\w\ gets money from his parents to pay rent/bills so he hardly ever leaves .<n>About 15 minutes into our romp, i thought i heard a noise but just figured it was either the upstairs neighbor or someone doing something outside .
 i was trying to run parts out of our automatic press .<n> coil of stock shifted and turned into [this]( http://i.imgur.com/r1z6ssf.jpg).<n>Now i can't just scrap it cause it's a 2000ft coil that costs about $1200 .
 after a night of passionate nosex, the gf make a joke about the 'bullet' on my sister's dresser.<n>\haha, it does favor that, doesn't it? however, naive and silly gf, that's lipstick. here, i'll show you.\ with that, i reach over and pop the cap of the lipstick container. maybe it wasn't maybelline, because batteries fell out.<n>then the heavy realization to make it worse, i have to pick it up and put it back together... lest i look like i tried to use it.
 i just got back from the gym and had a shower.<n>i decided to snap a pic of myself to send to the gf and also just as a general progress pic.<n>as i opened the picture, i pressed this one button which i assumed was the \share\ button. once clicked, nothing happened.<n>as i'm getting changed and heading down to grab some food, i start hearing my mum yelling at me very loudly.
 before we left i kinda had to poo but i couldn't do it, it was more of a \i'm gonna have to go eventually\ kind of thing .<n>i get out of the water and start walking back towards the trails.<n>One of my friends asks where i'm going an i have to go so bad i just say \illberightback!\ as fast as possible, cause losing focus on this means i will for sure have feces in my swimsuit .<n>Luckily i happen to have a shirt on over my swimsuit, so i begrudgingly take it off and wipe myself with
 i plug in my ipod so we can all listen to music while working.<n>the hall i was working in doesn't have a restroom, and the nearest one is right around the hall corner.<n> stepping into the hall i quickly realized my mistake; [killing in the name of](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwxazvhlyxq) was playing and blaring loud \fuck you\s throughout the halls.
 my best friend and i have known each other for sixteen years and tell each other everything .<n> fast forward to 2 years ago when they got back together. c and z get engaged and c cheats on z many times.<n> about a month ago, z starts txting me. pics are exchanged and we agree to hang out. c finds out and flips shit. starts calling both of us multiple times a day just bitching us out.<n>well, we hung out last night and ended up sleeping together. it was amazing and yet i feel awful.
 i hop in the shower to enjoy the jazzy tunes (because, who doesn't like to sing in the shower) and i don't bother to close the bathroom door because i'm home alone right?<n>getting out to dry off when my favorite, \when your good to mama\ is on.<n>i feel hot when i sing this song and began to dry off in a senutal mannor, i put my leg up on the closed toilet seat and having a little sexy time in the mirror to see what i look like if i ever get a boyfriend.
 when i was about eight i was at a party in my neighborhood when my stomach started to act up.<n>i decided to walk home to go to the bathroom because i thought i needed to poop.<n>after straining to push something out for a good 5 minuets, my face suddenly explodes with vomit.<n>i think the only reason i remember this is because it was the first time vomit ever came out my nose an it hurt like a bitch.
 i was trying to puke into the toilet since i felt like i had to puke, but i also felt a fart coming on. now i thought it was just a fart, wrong.<n>i ended up shitting into my pajama pants right there on the floor.
 i stumbled across a blue egg just sitting on the ground. it actually looked whole, but when i picked it up, i noticed it had a few holes in it where the unborn bird must have leaked out.<n>i went to my car to put it in there where i wouldn't forget it.<n>i looked down at the egg and then realized that a very dark brown liquid had leaked out onto my hand.
 servers steal stacks of coupons or print them from their computer under false emails .<n>The coupons are never really used when someone gives them cash and says keep the change end up being an extra five, ten, whatever dollars in their pocket .<n>i found out this mass coupon fraud was going on, and i \checked in\ a friend to her shift. not super close, but i've been to her house and drank after work and never had any problems with her. she seemed like a pretty cool chick.<n>i honestly had no idea she was one of the people stealing. she was suspended for a few days
 i was stuck against a chubby woman who was like 45+ for like 6 minutes .<n>i can't grab my phone to get it flat in my pocket since the woman's ass is basically on my leg .<n>i'm also very allergic to perfume, no more busing for me .
 after my friends depart from my place im feeling exhausted and want to go straight to bed, but first i had to piss.<n>i drain the pipes and head upstairs to my room. still drunk, i decided to browse the internet for a little bit.<n>still drunk, i close my laptop, turn on my ac, turn off the lights and hop in bed which felt fucking amazing after a long day.<n>i wake up the next morning still half asleep and thirsty as a motherfucker. without even thinking, i grab the gatorade bottle and start to drink my vegetated piss.
 i'm not going to elaborate because i don't even know how to.<n>my parents found out about my marijuana use, and i broke up with my girlfriend in 1 hour.<n>i'll elaborate in comments when i get my head straight, like i'm literally still shocked to the core.
 i became her tutor because she desperately needed tutoring in chemistry and i am good at science .<n>i was going to pick up my friend to go see a local concert so i go to text him i am in front of his house. his name is mason .<n>i completely forget that i had added mari. only when i saw \message sent to mari\ had i realized what i had done .<n>i held down my car horn in rage, and then the police came because i was causing a noise disturbance. so on to of the rapey text i got fined $50 and couldn't go to the concert
 i had a soundcloud account linked to my facebook, and started listening to some porn to get me off .<n>since it's linked, i start listening to some of that shit.<n>i start masturbating, and then i get a call from my mom. pause, stop, answer. \hello?\<n>\it says you were watching _ on facebook.\ \oh...it does?\ i start denying everything.<n>i then tell my mom i'll do something, hang up, and delete my account, hoping that the info will disappear. now here is my favorite part.
 when one uses the bathroom there is no question about whether it is 1 or 2. thought since nobody was upstairs that i had clearance to let one rip.<n>a faster than usual dash to the bathroom probably alerted everyone downstairs that there was something amiss.<n>Results from the first one indicated that this was going to be a fucking mess so i did what i had to do - folded that bitch in half and used it twice.<n>every square inch of clean white paper was going to be needed if i was going to get out of this without having to go home for lunch.
 Argentina is currently in a state of economic distress .<n>Many people have resorted to petty crime, such as pickpocketing, in an attempt to make ends meet .<n>A few days ago (today i didn't fuck up.. but i sure did on Saturday morning) i was leaving a guy's apartment after he had already left to go to work.<n>a few minutes later a man comes up to me and mentions i have a stain on my back and that i should clean it.<n>a few minutes later a street vendor is yelling at me, bringing me down to earth telling me that i had
 i don't like hard liquor, i don't like it and it doesn't like me.<n> amongst my friends and family there is a standing ban against two types of liquor specifically; vodka, because it makes me cry like a baby, and tequila, because i will (attempt) to have sex with pretty much anything. now i think whiskey will be added to that list.<n>my wife slugs me in the forehead until i let go, then a few more times in the side of the head and the shoulder/rib area for good measure before kicking me (literally) out of bed.
 i'd been planning to switch banks for some time now .<n>my bank has started assessing a $6 monthly service fee if your account balance falls below $500 during any time during the previous month .<n>if i was wealthy and could maintain a high balance, the account would be free .
 i work in a lab that tries to make crystals to see if a unique chemical structure is formed .<n>One time i was using ethanol as a solvent for my reaction, and i knew that the product formed from the reaction would not crystallize with ethanol .<n>Once the ethanol was vaporized, i was left with the product in the hot/warm beaker .<n>i noticed that the dichloromethane was vaporizing, like when you add water to hot skillet when you are washing it after you used it on the stove .
 i'm usually a really healthy eater so the introduction of this food into my system hasn't been treating me well today .<n>i was back in the bathroom to shit for the fourth time today and when i entered the bathroom i was talking on the phone and i forgot to lock the door .<n>i scramble and shut the stall door and lock it as fast as i can and i hear them say something when they noticed someone was inside, but they promptly left .
 i pay the guy and get these ticket things you throw down the chute with the garbage.<n>i put the garbage down the chute and reach in my pocket and grab the stickers and throw em down with the bags.<n>i drive home, let my dogs out, and then empty my pockets so i could take off my jacket and i find the two stickers still in my pocket.<n>So i flew back to the garbage man (going 65 in a 35 with a jeep cherokee mind you..) almost flipped my jeep on the way, and when i get there i explain the problem to the guy.

 when we were finished, they were all good, but i was feeling quite dizzy.<n>as we were leaving, i started feeling worse and worse in the car ride and i felt as if my skin was melting and the car was going at light speeds.<n>All of this lead to my mind telling me \i need to fucking throw up right now\, so i obliged, but thought, hey it would be a great idea to roll down the window first before throwing up.<n>nope, turns out throwing up while on the freeway with the window open causes the barf to come flying back in and hitting the person sitting

 laura and roger had been 'going to town' in her small car... on the seat... i was now sat in .<n>laura then decided to go in to great detail about how her and roger where doing it so hard that the seat got covered in all sorts of human baby making love juices .<n>i could feel rogers white super solider swimming across my face. now i am here... staring blankly in to my monitor after sitting in the shower for an hour and half. i feel violated... dirty almost.
 i had a nice seafood dinner this evening consisting of crab, scallops, and shrimp. everything seemed fine when i finished eating (my stomach grumbled a bit, but it's to be expected since i don't eat seafood very often)<n>a few hours go by and i'm sitting at my computer watching some netflix and enjoying a snack when i feel my stomach start to grumble.<n>i need to relieve some gas, so i do the ol' sideways lean while pondering how bad this will smell. we all know seafood tends to lead to some unique odours so midway through the lean i think \maybe i should head
 i threw a bag into the dumpster today and it got caught on the edge so it was half in and half out at the end of the bin .<n>as i reached for the bag, my foot slipped off the side of the bin and with a loud \fuck\ i went straight in .<n>i've got a lovely bruise and scrape on my thigh (about fist size around) but other than that i'm ok .
 i was told to wash a rug that had a rubber backing on it and was extremely gross.<n>i asked if it needed to be washed with the hose outside but was instead told that it could be thrown directly in the washing machine.<n>i figured that if it could be put in the washing machine i could wash it on sanitize and it would be extra clean.
 i was outside cutting the grass when i stopped to bag the grass clippings.<n>i heard the phone ring inside, but didn't think anything of it since it would go to voice mail.<n>i went to listen to it and it starts out.. \this message is for rrims. we've received your online application and would like to schedule a face-to-face interview. please give us a call at...\<n>i go call to my dad to come inside and take a listen (i'm excited i finally got a call back)

 i'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of valentines day candy .<n>out of nowhere a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands .<n>i immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, i sink in a rear naked choke .<n>i'm borderline sick today and the only reason i even went to school was because i had a huge test .
 \i'm on vacation!\ i would shout at the on-lookers gathering with sadness and pity in their eyes.<n>i actually don't know why i would think that. that's not even a thing that makes sense to think.<n>the line was insane and every toilet is precious real estate and the small bladdered old men behind me panic because they should sell beer in the restroom line. seriously, they should sell beer in the restroom line. seriously.<n>i forgot two reasons -- 1) if you run out, you are literally trapped in line and wasting valuable drinking time. 2) the lines are long enough
 after a month of saving up to pay a super speeder ticket, i was finally out of debt (with *only* 6 points on my record... sigh)<n>My car came with the rod unbolted from the engine bay and just sits in the trunk instead.<n>my fuck up was laying it on top of the latch that secures the hood down just so that i could go in and pay for the oil and hose quickly instead of fully closing it first.
 i really wanted some pops because i was hungry and nothing else caught my eye, so i ate a bowl of milk and the cereal.<n>i started coughing ( i have a very weird dry cough so it feels like a lion's scraping the inside of my chest.)<n>like a car crash happening in slow motion, i realized i was going to throw up.<n>i start barfing in the hallway, and put my hand up to my chin, catching all of my half digested pops and goo in my hand.<n>i bolt to the toilet and start letting it out, using my good hand to hold my hair

 i go to the bathroom to pee after a few beers. the urinals were full so i go to a stall.<n>i going pee and i see an empty glass on top of the toilet. so, for a reason unknown to myself i blast that fucker with beer colored piss and put it right back.<n>Later on i go back to the same stall and the glass was empty. now i can't say for sure it was my friend, but i all of the sudden realize upon seeing the empty glass that my friend will sometimes drink wounded strangers (rando, beer unclaimed)
 this is the first date i've ever been on. yes with anyone (i hope you're getting all excited right now like \dis gon be good\).<n>well for starters i'm fucking 150 pounds and secondly i may or may not be under 21. but yolo i like alcohol why not.<n>pretty much everyone has like 3-4 shots, except me, because i'm going to impress this girl. so instead of having a few shots, i have 10, in about 15 minutes. so as you can imagine i'm fucking trashed.
 i live at home with my mom, grandma and great grandma (so much estrogen)<n> caitlyn says hi and then my great grandma turns to me and says \wasnt her name rachel the other day?\<n>i tried to explain, but she didn't believe me. she didn't say much else the rest of the day.<n>it also happens that i know a rachel from another class and she hits on me a lot, so when i handed caitlyn my phone to show my monogomy, rachel decides it is the best time to text me and say \what's up
 This actually happened last night so i guess it's more like lnifu.<n>i was watching tv, being generally lazy after putting the kids to bed and decided that during the next commercial break i'd go get my nightly snack.<n>so the commercial comes on and i decide to try and pull a risky business slide across the kitchen floor because hey, that's always fun, right?<n>i go into my slide like a pro, arm outstretched to grasp the cabinet knob as it comes into range and successfully open the cabinet door in one fluid movement.<n>then i remember a feeling of euphoria and being very comfortable

 i'm a part timer working for the british army voluntarily.<n> occasionally i work with cadets but mostly do paperwork. anyway now and again i get the chance to apply for more exciting work which can include having to visit quite senior officers.<n> so i was sitting at a desk filing in forms about how many piles of mud needed to be cleaned and which maniac should be let loose with a shovel when i was summoned to the company commanders office.
 my parents left me home alone for a week while they where in las Vegas.<n>i tried to do what any teenager left home alone for a week would try to do, have a huge party.<n>i got some of my friends to help me setup, we moved almost everything that was breakable into siderooms, even some of the furnature.<n>immidiently they ask where they can go to smoke, i told them to exit the backyard, through the gate and smoke in the little park i back onto.<n>my neighbours, who are really good friends with my parents saw, and about contacted my parents,
 i'm 20 f and he's 27 but the age gap doesn't bug either of us .<n>everything was going great, we would talk every day and although i miss him so much it's not bad .<n>i'd been going through some personal rough patches and really felt the need to get hammered, which is the stupidest thing to do in my situation .<n>i felt like it was too late to back out, that it would be easier for me to just finish the job than to get away at that point .

 i went on a trip to the coast in Italy, travelling alone so unfortunately nobody to help me keep my head screwed on .<n>it started with a quiet sunset beer, absolutely stunning setting in a fairly sleepy town.<n>cut to 3 hours later and i'm left with a group of italians we'd also met that evening but slowly realising i'm losing the ability to speak in either language.<n>i decide to be 'sensible' and head back to the hostel at this point before i make things worse.<n> crashing down from the top bunk i run to the toilet to have a mega chunder,

 Physical therapy caused my leg to reach a soreness level to where i had a limp when i walked.<n>i needed some relief from the soreness; like any other athlete i reach for my favorite analgesic called biofreeze.<n> biofreeze uses this menthol combination that you roll onto sore or achy parts of your body which creates this cooling effect and promotes blood flow to the area.
 since i have amazon prime, i said i would 2-day ship it to her house so that it could be there in time for the festivities.<n> since i am moving soon and had no idea when they would ship, i changed my address to my parents address to assure that i would be able to still get them, should i have moved before they arrived.<n>This morning my mom receives a box labeled to me from fedex and obviously assumes that it was the mosquito repellent that i had shipped to her, so she opens it without a second thought only to find various sex toys for both male and female intended for her (now

 today has not been a good day, and it's only 1:30.<n>my alarm interrupted me. groaning, i sat up, looking blearily at the time, and muttered something offensive to alarm clocks.<n>i grabbed my can of brand-non-specific cola soft drink from last night and gave it a shake.<n>i take a sip, and frown. this isn't right. it's granular. since when was coke granular.<n>i'm horrified to find ants. dozens of them. crying out in shock, i fling them off my hand, about the room, and begin to spit everywhere

 i haven't slept since Sunday because my job is a wee bit demanding at the moment .<n>i recently moved to a new duty station and today is day 3 of my new job .<n>i'm still unsure if it was fecal matter exiting my sphincter at mach 2 or just the remnants of what my colon used to be .
 tonight i was coming home from a friend's house after a fun night of gta v (not relevant to the story, but still a super fun game) and my eyes tricked me into thinking the light was green when it was actually red.<n>Luckily i didn't crash, unluckily there was a cop car sitting at the light and he instantly pulled me over. now i have a $120 citation.
 recently i've been really turned on by the thought of anal pleasure, i had gone in just a little but not much and always cleaned up after not even knowing if i had to .<n>Last night is when it happened, i applied some lube and went at it with my fingers, i decided to go a little deeper than usual and damn it felt so good!<n>i didn't sleep that night, i currently am having sleeping issues and need to get checked for insomnia, well i completely forgot about the lube still all the way in my ass.<n>i really shouldn't have ate a f

 i found taking walks in the middle of the night just before going to bed to be very relaxing and helping me with my issues .<n>One night i felt that the walking wasn't enought and i had to rub one out aswell before going to bed. or even better, lay in bed watching my monitor a couple feet away (2 meters)

 i wore my favourite jeans that i've had for years.<n>i didn't think anything of it, until i looked down. years of wiping my hands on my thighs was now glowing in the lights, which wasn't visible before.
 when i'm under the influence, i fuck up a lot .<n>i say things i don't think i would say sober or i would not say them the way i do .<n>i recognize a girl that is in one of my class. i say ''hey, i know you, you're in one of my class''. she says ''oh i've never seen you''

 i went to bed at about 6 am last night and woke up at about 8 this morning, only getting two hours of sleep.<n>i was a little melancholy about being alone and not having any plans on valentine's day, and so far the only valentine's day text i had received was from my sister.<n>i wake up at four and have a billion texts from this boy that i really, really, really, like, sent just after i fell asleep, asking if i'd like to go on a date with him at two o'clock.<n>i woke up two hours past that and i feel so
 i got up at 530am to get ready for work, and am still a little groggy from my ambien i took the night before.<n>i turned on the coffee pot, and the warmer plate up to high because, well, my fianc\u00e9 likes his coffee to go into the thermos hot, dammit.<n>i give him the mug and he sits down to drink it. i go work on some dishes.<n>my ocd starts driving me up the wall knowing i've cleaned all the dishes in the kitchen, but that i can't rinse the coffee pot yet cause there's a sip or two
 when i woke up and got dressed, i looked between my newer more comfortable boots and an older and heavier pair.<n>i grab the old pair because they are closer. and that is how i ended up with blisters all over the bottoms of my feet.
 when i left on sunday i took *all* of our combined toys back with me .<n>i put them in the non-notebooks compartment of my backpack and went about my week .<n>an hour ago i'm walking into math class, and i guess the weight of that textbook was too much on my bag because as i'm walking in front of the class to take my seat, my backpack's zipper finally snaps and out flies everything .
 i was using my galaxy tablet reddit app as a newspaper while i was dropping the kids off at the pool, for those who might not get the last half of the last line, i was taking a dump.<n>i got so tuned into reading all sorts of stuff from the front page that a good long period of time passes by.<n>Decided to put my galaxy down so i can stand up to wipe, get halfway up and then feel myself falling forward, before i know it i've just rammed my head into the bathroom door.
 after a run i decided to drink my gatorade and sit on the bench right next to the parking lot.<n>i get back in my car and as i'm driving home, i realize i left my shirt and phone on the roof of my car.<n>i drive back to the parking lot and in the entrance is my shirt and obliterated phone.<n>After getting torn a new one from my dad i was then phone less, car-less, weed-less, and wallet-less.
 as a teenager, i have to text my mother letting her know i arrived at school safely.<n>as i'm walking under a scaffold, i decide to take my phone out and text her. one (and i mean one) drop of rain drips onto it and i didn't give a fuck because i didn't think the drop would do anything.<n>A week later, actually a few hours before i typed this, so i'm at the apple store's \genius bar\ (a bit pretentious, apple?) and they tell me that water damage isn't covered.
 i got carried away yesterday and sent a mass mail to my whole batch at midnight declaring that all the lectures of the next day have been cancelled.<n>i used the registrar's e-mail address as the sender. that must be one of the stupidest mistakes of my life.<n>the actual registrar then sent a mail saying that his account had been \hacked\ and no classes have been cancelled.
 campho-phenique on my eye when my 7 month old starts crying .<n>i realize my error with the campho-phenique and was glad my son snapped me out before this happened .<n>after several rinses and 3 hours later, my eye doesn't burn anymore. it just feels a bit numb.
 i arrived at the station at the last minute, the train was pulling into the station.<n>i could have prevented this all together had i not left my wallet at home last fiday and purchased my ticket then.<n>i assume the lady was in such a hurry, she dropped her ticket after purchasing it. she boarded the train...with no ticket.
 An average looking guy came in and explained that he had accidentally locked his keys in his car while picking it up from the auto repair shop next door .<n>He asked if we had a coat hanger or something that he could use to pry the door open.<n>i told him that we didn't have any coat hangers and that i couldn't think of anything that he might be able to use.

 swastikas, penises, racism, sexism, religion-ism, you name it.<n>on the back of the book, there was a picture i drew of jesus, on a cross, crying for help.<n>about a week later, i get called down to the office. the principal, the guidance counselor, and my teacher were all there.<n>when you get down to it, they were making this out to be a cry for help, and using the picture of jesus on the back to convince me that i need therapy.
 my only access to the internet is through my phone, because i can no longer afford prices from major telecom providers.<n>i let my boss know what the problem was, and why i couldn't respond to his emails, but he's told me he must stick with his decision.<n>i have worked my ass off for this man, after waiting months for the store to open so i could actually start work.
 i wanted a wet/dry shop vac for my garage, and bought a bargain one at a liquidator/take-back outlet store.<n>part of the deal was that it was as-is and no return.<n>got it home and realized it had no hose and no attachments, just the extension nozzles.
 i'm at his parent's house with him in the games room and things are getting steamy .<n>having requested for him not to fap for a few days to make his orgasm really powerful, he gets into it pretty intensely .<n>i lean back, pull my pants up, sit down and begin to do the largest, longest queef i have ever heard .<n>it sounds like a diarrhoea fart of the worst kind and last about 30 seconds.<n>the fluid is sputtering out of my cavity like a waterfall accompanied by all the air that'd been pounded in there from the shenanigans
 i saw about a dozen small plants, slightly larger than a toonie each, with inch-long spikes extending at all angles. my (wimpy) shouts of (mostly surprise and agony soon drew the attention of my squadmates. they were polite enough not to laugh, but the nearest officer had a chuckle as he lent me his multitool to rip the bloody things out.<n> oddly enough, the large spike sunk a full centimeter into my leg bled not at all, while the tiny spike barely breaking the surface released at least a teaspoon and a half of blood to run down my shin.
 \i'm glad you found something you like!\<n>\Yeah, well my mom normally does all my shopping, so this is a first for me!\<n>\well it's good that you're getting out there!\
 my sister is 14 and is a huge drama queen. she over exaggerates everything and always have .<n>we (mostly i) spoke about our feelings towards my parents (divorced, he lives in NYC and she lives in tx, we live with her, he has decided to sue for custody) and emotional issues (she's constantly angry and i'm depressed).<n>we talked for about two hours and then i started rambling and she wasn't responding, so i assumed she was listening and carried on talking.<n>a few minutes later when she did, she told me she felt trapped in her body and like
 i thought it would be fun to get tipsy and have sex, cause its generally pretty fun.<n>well no that didn't happen. so we were in bed and i've had 5 glasses of wine, feeling the perfect tipsy, i got into my lingerie and m bf was finding us something to watch to set the mood, just for a little fun.<n>and it had been maybe half an hour and i felt something happening, i sat up, and puked into my hand and all over the carpet.<n>so my bf slowly leads me to the bathroom to clean myself up and incase i
 i recently went to the dermatologist about these bumps on my skin which i thought were eczema.<n>I have a fairly common condition known as keratosis pilaris.<n>If you're unfamiliar with it, it basically means that hair follicles cannot break through my skin and so they pile up underneath and cause bumps.
 i asked one of my coworkers to purchase me a package of googly eyes to decorate these motivational posters for child support .<n>i went out to answer a ticket, i would place another pair of eyes on another poster until i had an [album](http://i.imgur.com/a/sefja) of joy to throw around, thinking \what harm could be done with some googly eyes?\<n>a week later, my coworkers get a letter of reprimand stating that they observed me placing googly eyes on a poster and did not report the vandalism .
 We let our dog off the leash when we reach an open field full of stubble .<n>As we walked up the other pathway, we see a couple with their dog .<n>A few moments later, our dog, nala, goes out of sight, seconds pass and i hear her barking .<n>We have no home insurance to cover it, and we have no home insurance to cover it, and i am a fucking student... but the annoying thing is that the path was right next to a public footpath, and there were no signs saying 'private land, do not tresspass' etc .
 today was a day like any other, except that by chance i woke up unusually early.<n>no problem- hop out of bed, usual routine, toss my clothes in the dryer, set timer for longer so they'll be ready in time to get dressed for work, go about my business. right?<n>Instead of twenty minutes, they're in the dryer for an hour and a half.<n>it's important to note that i generally go commando, so there was nothing to protect my bits 'n berries from the searing awfulness that happened next.
 she tells me about this mental disorder which is fake, i looked it up. she says the exploit this illness and it makes her cut herself.<n>i then joked 'thats why (boy you like) dumped you' and she went ballistic.<n>3 hours later and i'm going be murdered because i'm insensitive.
 fortunately, i was using the urinal at the time, so i was able to quickly switch to the stall, but not before causing irreparable damage to my underwear and pants .<n>the worst part is, i had to go home, shower, and change, making me late for my son's first holiday concert!
 i'm absolutely shitted, and decided to treat myself to having a bath, which is a luxury as baths make my hair go weird and so i can't have them during the week as i have to style my hair and all that stupid shit.<n>the bath was shit. the bath water was all from the hot tap, yet there was no hot water in the bathtub.<n>my mum always gets pissed at me whenever i don't wash out the bath as soon as i get out of the bath, so i go to do that, as well as put my jewellery back on and get my clothes from off

 my professor is an old family friend, so i knew him before this class and had his number from a few years back.<n>my boyfriend happens to have the same name as him. he got a new number today, and before i had it saved as \(his name) 3\, so there was never any ambiguity.<n> prior to class, i was with my boyfriend, so i hadn't texted him in hours while i had been texting other people, so our convo thread was close to the bottom of all my texts .<n>basically, the text went something along the lines of \i can't
 while holding the baby he let go a fart of all farts, or so i thought(sounded like an orchestra of tuba players)<n>while she was changing him i decided to eat my delicious five layer beef burrito.<n>When the taste hit my taste buds i immediately start puking everywhere, on her newly shampooed carpet, on her microfiber couch, and all on myself.
 i was doing some yardwork to help my parents out and had gloves on for most of the time. at the very end when i was done, i had to put some of the ivy and weeds i had chopped in a trash bag and somehow some poison ivy got mixed up in the bunch.<n>i wiped sweat right above my eyes/eyelids and had to readjust by boys because the pants were a little tight.<n>the next morning, i spotted the poison ivy on my hand and new it was about to get bad.
 we only had cold water in our dorm since a few days ago .<n>the plumber came over in the morning and i had the hangover of my life .<n>while he was in the bathroom to fix the water heater, it just got worse.<n>i ran into the bathroom and threw up like i never did before.<n>when i finished, i turned around and he gave me the most awkward look ever.

 i met my best friends sister two days ago, she's incredibly cute but it was his sister so i thought i'd talk to him about it first .<n>he says it's fine hook up, whatever, but then i did, twice, while he was home. he told me to stop but i didn't, i called her and we hooked up a third time .<n>Later that night, my other good friend's ex from 2 years ago hits me up to hang out .<n>she and i were always good friends and i'm pretty sure my buddy is completely over her so
 i was lying down on my bed, sonar mode engaged, when i heard footsteps nearby .<n>my dick brushed up against my thigh or my pants or something, then i knew i wasn't going to be able to control it .<n>my dad does this thing where he will randomly tell me that he loves me, sometimes with a hug, and i really don't mind it, i'll even say it back and all. but this time as he hugs me i can just feel myself coming in my pants, while i awkwardly maintain my crotch as far away from his body as humanly possible .
 i tried to remove pressure that stuck too well to a large piece of glass that brought tension upwards (like peeling a band-aid from your skin)<n>hopefully this will be a warning lesson to some so that they can avoid doing the same things and learn from my misfortune.
 out of shape, nervous, anxious, and full of pee, i stepped up to the group of girls preparing for the race.<n>i tried to keep up with the leading runners, oblivious to their varsity status. on the first lap, i wasted all my energy.<n> comfortably in the middle of the pack, i started hyperventilating and got a side stitch.<n>i just noped out of the race. tears, walking, more hyperventilating, just the epitome of a screw up.
 initially, i thought it was just another one of those gas cramps. but it soon became almost unbearable and overwhelming.<n> ended up sharting on myself.<n> quickly lost all interest on my final and try to ask the prof if i can be excused for bathroom. did a walk of shame all the way to the bathroom while clenching whatever mess i still had brewed inside. turns out the shit stained my shorts.
 i realize about half-way in that the fan blowing on high is blowing directly onto where our body's intertwined .<n> suddenly, what sounds like a massive trumpet note blares from my vagina .<n>i try to hold in the laughter as he is about to finish. he pulls out, and i can hold it no longer .
 I recently softmodded my wii to play gamecube games saved to a flash drive .<n>All of my save data from the past 10 years or so of all the games i've played on the gamecube is gone .
 having lice in your hair is one thing - but having a constant itch in your pubes?<n>my gf asked me if i was sick or something, because i was walking like a penguin who just got shot in the crotch.<n>at the end of the date, i could barely walk home with her, and she was getting really suspicious.

 i am a member of a couple private torrent trackers for porn. this has resulted in me having quite a [big amount](http://imgur.com/pqqcsgg) of porn on my hard drive .<n>my porn folder is hidden away quite well. now, my porn folder is hidden away quite well. the actual torrent files are not, since people looking around my computer folders is not a regular occurrence .

 we went to a restaurant with my dad, that serves the best salami pizza in the galaxy.<n>i wolfed down the giant pizza like a starving t-rex, it was a nice meal, and we had dessert, and after that, we left the restaurant, and i start to feel a little queasy.<n>when i go to bed, i still have this odd feeling in my stomach, but i proceed to browse a little reddit, and then go to sleep.<n>in the morning, i wake up to the feeling of my guts being roasted with the power of a thousand suns!
 i decided to stop being lazy yesterday morning and give my dog a real long nice walk, so i get dressed in moderately nice clothing and set out, everything is fine, dog is doing dog stuff, i'm doing people stuff, yet then i begin to get annoyed by the zillion or so bugs that are bothering me, annoying flies and such.<n>unfortunately, i walked into a thick of flies, and spasmd out a bit with head, and while the bugs were sent flying, in my lack of vision during this process, i happened to trip over the cobblestone walk on my left and almost comically fell into a huge
 i have an acer aspire laptop that was bought on my scholarship, and is only four months old.<n>being touchscreen, i was getting four hours out of the battery with windows 8, and decided linux would hopefully make the battery last an hour more.<n> install ubuntu without a hitch, go to boot into it, and there are no os'es on my lappy.
 so i'm now sitting on reddit, and not sure whether to worry about my exam, or what i'm going to wear there...<n>typical tifu really. was revising for my exam this afternoon, smelt something...something i knew. oh crap. literally. how i didn't notice beats me.<n>but the real problem? they were my last pair of underwear, and my exam is in an hour so i have no time to do my washing.
 i work in a chemical plant and in the area i am at today there is a single restroom with a locked door. so i clench my ass and haul myself over to the crapper.<n>well my shit started to slowly squeeze itself out with every step i am taking but i finally make it.<n>well i hear the door open to the little building i am in taking a shit and figure whoever walked in will see the restroom door is closed and won't come in. nope! a minute later this old operator in his late 50s walks up and opens the door that i thought i locked while i'm
 i (a male) was walking across campus at my university past our big clock tower.<n>i hear a girl yelling through a megaphone about her experience with date-rape, and i think \uh oh, there's one of the feminists meetings here\<n>i decide to look up to see that i have walked straight into this meeting and am standing about 5 feet away from the girl with the megaphone.<n>she has stopped talking and is staring at me along with roughly 50 girls.<n>this moment could only be made worse by my wardrobe choice that day.
 i merely skimmed through his status and thought to myself that he was giving a send off to his class such as 'its been fun' or 'good luck to you guys in the future'<n>i commented, trying to bust his balls by saying 'let's see how you feel in college... ' some other person comments 'who's this douchebag?\<n>i promptly deleted my comment and messaged my friend and the other person, explaining that i misread the status.
 i have always had a taste for odd foods .<n>i'll look at a menu and see something such as monkey toes or bumble bee's urethra and my response 9 out of 10 times is \hell yeah i want that weird ass shit\<n>the moment i put it in my mouth the smell and taste hit me and i was like a deer caught in headlights, expect instead of lights it was a dick that smells like shit in my mouth .<n>after i left i went home and sat in my bed reconsidering my life choices and cringing as the smell of poop and sex still clung
 I randomly find one of my airaoft BB's on my bed and while i'm laying there on my phone just start to mess around with it in my hand.<n>I put it by my ear and set it in the little gap part. then as i go to take it put my finger knocks it in and it falls down into my ear canal.<n>I then proceed to try and take it out but it's already lodged in.
 i woke up very hungry and only a little bit nauseous so i decided to make myself some breakfast.<n>i have english muffins, egg, cheese, and baloney, so i thought i'd make myself a breakfast sandwich.<n>while it was waiting to heat i grabbed a used stick of butter. as i began to unwrap it i got an odd sense of almost dejavu \u2013 this stick of butter looks like something i've seen before.<n>it doesn't really make sense, i don't think semen ordinarily looks like a hard stick of butter.<n>i became instantly nauseous anyway and puked onto
 i went to a friends house last night after being invited for a party.<n>I left my wallet filled with $120 inside of it.<n>I tried to ask around to my friends and people i've never met but too many people were coming and going i couldn't figure it out.
 i thought it would be a good idea to take my brother-in-law out to a party that was filled with some of my really close friends.<n>he mixed his liquors with a couple of beers as well as a couple of ciders. he gave himself alcohol poisoning.<n>i drove the car closer so he could just climb in and i would take him home. turns out he still needed to puke some and while doing that he also released some from the other end.<n>i have to think quickly on how to take care of this without causing a scene at the party and drawing attention.
 i was watching a soccer game with my parents when the water started dripping .<n>My father called our insurance company to get someone out to assess and fix the water damage and the water heater .<n>About halfway down my street i realize my bowels have decided to yell \fuck you and everything you stand for\<n>i have shit on the side of my leg and on my shoes and my boxers are destroyed .
 Some time after dinner, i touched my dick, and the little amount of capsaicin from the jalapeo transferred over and began irritating the foreskin .<n>i tried using saliva and milk to remedy it to no avail (i've heard that milk has some enzyme or something, but never really looked into it)<n>Since this was mostly unsuccessful, and since i still had quite a bit of pain, after much delaying i stuck my dick in a cup of canola oil .
 i was introduced to this devilishly addicting game a few days ago, and my roommate and i were playing nonstop .<n>Then, a computer broke. not because we were clicking too much, or the computer overheated, but because in my excitement over my roommate's golden cookie powerup i knocked over a glass of water onto his new macbook pro .
 i had a whole package of those extra-long necklace glowsticks on the floor in my bedroom.<n>i stepped on the package by accident and cracked all of them.<n>i figured, \well, why waste them?\ so i finished cracking them, shook them all up, and looped them together.<n>then i turned off the light .<n>to find my entire room was speckled green. one of the green ones had cracked open.
 i've been writing a powershell script to find and delete redundant $recycle.bin files in our thousands of user personal folders.<n>It works perfectly fine. it takes a matter of minutes and gives beautiful log and error output info.<n>then i notice that i'm not using the same standardised variable name for the folder i'm trying to clear out, so i edit one of my functions to bring it into line.<n>i run the script and check my error logs. instead of the 78 kb file i'm expecting (from previous runs it was that size), i get a 4.9 mb file.
 dream world: loki is suing the police because a cop urinated on him and broke his arm.<n>dream: i go to take a piss into my toilet/loki's food bowl because this is dream world and loki lives in a toilet.<n>dream: i shove my dick into one of these 2 boxes but 2 things are wrong here.
 so these are fairly old pants and i have had to put a safety pin through the top.<n>the button busted a while ago so the pin is good enough. so then when i go to take a piss and i undo the safety pin and i start my stream then i feel a massive pain in my nut sack, look down and i have pierced a pin hole in the bottom on my nuts.
 i teach tennis, and i take ice in the mornings to put in the cooler so kids have cold water to drink throughout the day.<n>here's me being smart, thinking i can save a bit of money by buying ice in 20lb bags and sticking in a freezer we keep in the garage mostly for meat, steak, fajita meat, chicken, etc.
 My girlfriend was hitting my bong. its about two feet so i usually torch it for her and pull the bowl because she cant see when its burnt all the way.<n>well this time i put just a wee bit too much bud in the bowl because she gave me the signal to pull it before it was done burning.<n>So i pull it and i put my mouth above the bowl and suck the smoke up.<n>i ended up sucking up the still burning cherry of the bowl and it went straight down my throat burning the shit out of everything it touched.
 i was contacted by the woman that used to have my new phone number.<n>She left me a voicemail stating that she turned on her ipad for the first time in 5 months, and it loaded all the text messages i sent and received from my new number.
 i was edging, getting near the point of cumming, for quite a while now and was near busting.<n>well, shit, my underwear are on the other side of the room after a passionate throw for the the excitement of making some baby batter.<n>i get up to put them on, but just at that moment, i went over the edge.<n> scrambling for my underwear, i start cumming everywhere; my legs, the carpet, my hands, and for a good 5 seconds after putting on my underwear.
 i found a rake and placed it in the yard and then i stomped the ever loving shit out of it .<n>you can imagine my surprise when an instant later i had a very sharp vertical pain emanating from my face as well as two busted lips .
 i couldn't sleep last night (at a time that was technically today) so i decided to watch this movie .<n>i watched the first one and personally i thought it was nothing, maybe one or two cringe-worthy scenes but i've seen worse, so i decided to watch the second one .<n>though i did fall asleep soon after finishing it, though i don't know if it's because i have a high tolerance for horror/gore, or because i took a sleeping pill before watching it or both .
 i had braces at the time, so they somehow ended up getting caught in some of the lacing of the mesh binder .<n>i spent at least 10 minutes facedown on the desk trying to \unbrace\ myself from the binder while the class laughed at me .
 a friend and i are approximately age 12, walking through a construction site.<n>i see a large route 44 sonic cup (they are 44 ounces and made of styrafoam.)<n>i'm thinking fuck this cup i'm gonna stomp this shit. but i some how miss, my inner angst wants to destroy this cup; so i must find something to keep it in place.... a board with a nail through it.<n>i set this route 44 kingdom atop the nail for placement purposes, and sure enough i stomp on it. nail only went halfway into my foot.
 the next morning, i farted and the fart woke me. it wasn't a regular everyday fart, but a shart.<n>Luckily, i always sleep on my stomach so there were no stains.<n>i wiped, flushed and ran straight to the shower, washed my pants which were beach shorts so they dried really quickly. chilled for about an hour before i left.
 I\u2019d never made this kind of soup before .<n>I put the ingredients in the pot. in go the pieces of cut up carrot, and the cut up onion, the chicken legs .<n>the second error was not following my mothers specific advice of tasting as i went.<n>i just put it all in the pot, brought it to the boil, and then reduced to a simmer. left it for about an hour. when i came back to it, it smelt pretty good.<n>i went to sleep that night hungry, with the smell of smoke in my nostrils.<n>only today has the place really started
 i've had a best friend for about 3 years (let's call him andy)<n>andy and i have had crazy sexual tension since day one but we had never acted on it.<n>andy has a roommate, ben, an extremely good looking soccer player.<n>since andy and i are friends and ben is generally a homebody, the three of us ended up spending a lot of time together in their apartment .
 i got guitar hero 4 world tour for pc because i don't own any consoles.<n> when playing it, the fret keys are mapped to \zxcvb\ and strum is the \up arrow\<n>i ended up getting my ass kicked and booed off by the game.
 \i was hammered quicker than usain bolt runs** (yep, shouldn't have drunken a bottle captain alone while all the others were listening to the a speech of our principal, maybe my mistake)\<n>\i've done quite a lot, but i'm pretty sure you will tell me something i don't know\
 so i cheated super hard on my chem final exam (got the answers before the test), and proceeded to get a b (aka not failing the class)<n>my buddy knew i had it and asked if he could have it after i used it. i didn't care, but i told him that if he got caught, to, and i quote, \not nark on me\<n>he proceeded to use it, and get caught (you have to be real fucking dumb to get caught cheating in this class). and when he was threatened with 10 days (just a threat), he gave up my name.
 in our work chat room (only for employees, no customers), a question was asked, which i knew the answer was in one of our blog posts, which are listed in a google doc.<n>i do my command c, command v and enter. but the google docs and copy/paste gods hate me. because... earlier in that day, my friend was going through a divorce, and her stb ex-husband was making her life difficult.<n>i told her to send pics of some of her more intimate parts, and tell him that he used to own them, but now they belonged to someone else, her.
 my old dentist said my teeth were fine and i just needed to brush and floss regularly.<n>i'll admit i didn't floss nearly enough (like none at all), but every check up showed my teeth as healthy and cavity free.<n>my old dentist retired recently so i switched to a new dentist and went for a check up today.<n>well we started off with a deep (fuckin ow) cleaning. my gums were bleeding all over the damn place.<n>as my check up progressed, it became clear that i had some serious issues built up from over the years.
 i am sure you know what he found. given the title, i am sure you know what he found.<n>he comes out cursing and yelling loud enough for everyone to hear \that bitch's tits are hanging out!\ he was furious, so we did a number of shots i am sure i don't want to remember.
 i am not usually terrified of spiders but this one looked too big to be a garden spider to me, although it most likely was not a brown recluse either.<n>i am not usually terrified of spiders but i do live in an area with brown recluses and this one looked too big to be a garden spider to me, although it most likely was not a brown recluse either.
 i\u2019m relatively new to reddit but here's a shameful story that, although ended somewhat triumphantly, was a personal defeat.<n>i went camping with some friends and we just got back from drunken canoeing so we were extremely hungry. we started the fire and cooked burgers and hot dogs. while waiting for the food to cook we drank and smoked.<n>after the festivities, we ate to our drunken hearts content.<n>Unfortunately, the pre game upset my stomach and for some reason caused me to only have partial control over my bladder.<n>i don't know if the beer, or beer mixed with smoking caused this
 after a few hours i said fuck it let's get wasted so we drank from one bar to another until we pretty much got carried away and i blacked out .<n>the moment i gained consciousness, i was lying on the sidewalk next to the boarding house i live in (how could i miss?) checked what time it is--hold on, *where the fuck is my watch?*<n>still too buzzed to care, i assumed i left my wallet and phone in one of the bars and tripped while walking home, so i just went inside and luckily the gatekeeper's there to open me up
 i wasn't feeling good this morning but decided to go to work anyway. it was just a stomach ache.<n>One hour into it, my stomach is in great pain, but i'm putting on a great act and doing my job.<n> 45 minutes later, the manager has me come inside to work at the counter because i can't even fucking stand at this point.<n> unable to hold it in, i throw up in the sink. then it gets clogged.<n>i had zero fucking clue what to do at this point, so i do what any good human with a soul would do, and
 we were loading up the minivan with stuff, with my car parked next to it in the driveway.<n>my little brother, for some reason, just wanted to stay in the car, so i opened the door and left the windows open (it was hot today). eventually, he told us he wanted some water.<n>my mom was also getting a little irritated at both him and me, complaining the whole time about how all we do is just sit around and do nothing.<n>i, being annoyed at my mom and forgetting that i left my car door opened, opened the passenger side of the van into my car door, in
 i was staying over my 2nd cousins house for the night because my parents were out and couldn't trust me in the house alone .<n>we were just talking late at night when she just kissed me..just right there and then, all i managed to say was \what did you just do that for?\<n>the next day i woke up stark naked realising what i did, popped on my clothes and went for breakfast.. later, around afternoon, i went to go and feed my nans cats whilst she was on holiday.<n>this time my first cousin was there(she goes round to our
 i informed my friend that i had taken some xanax earlier in the day (about 1mg which is way more than i usually take for my anxiety but had a very stressful day)<n>i wake up around 5 or 6 am and that's when i realized this wetness beneath me, i had pissed myself.<n>i figure if i do it right here on the couch maybe the blood will cover it, then again i'm sure my body would shit and piss when it's over anyways so that's not a good idea.<n>i apologize a thousand times, told him i was contemplating blaming his awesome dog(which
 i needed to look up information on what bill collectors are allowed to do (stupid  huh, different story) so i went to the public computer lab on campus.<n>these particular machines are set up in really long rows with the tower on the desk next to the monitor and each computer/monitor evenly spaced.<n>the only open computer was in the middle of a long row next to a girl who had about 5 documents open between spreadsheets, power points, word, internet and whatever.<n>i tried to log in but it took longer than the 15 seconds i was willing to wait, so i assumed it froze and i needed to
 every day i refill my bottle of water, put it in the freezer, and wait just before it gets totally frozen so it's sort of like a water slush .<n>well, first sip i take a shard of ice rockets out of the bottle and, sure enough, scrapes the crap out of my tongue .
 after school some of my friends and i decided to head by goodwill to buy some cheap clothes. soon a mega shopping spree ensues and completely forget about my backpack.<n>My jacket is missing. thinking i must've just put it down somewhere, i rush back, telling my friends i'd be back soon. it's gone.<n>my fucking glasses are gone too. we head back once again, but just like my jacket, they're gone without a trace.<n>i gave the store my phone number, and details about the missing items, but i believe they were stolen from my backpack.
 i decided to run behind her and put my hand in her back to make her run a little .<n>the moment a placed my hand on her back, she loses balance and falls .<n>she goes to the bleachers and went back to the waiting line; my friends are laughing, they think i did it as a joke .<n>about 5 mins later i go to check on her. her right arm and knee got scraped and she is crying. she calls mom.<n>i feel like shit, tried to help my sister and end up hurting her when i'm supposed to protect her.
 my sister is in the army and has been having health issues .<n>the procedure took longer than anyone expected .<n>because of hippa laws that i wouldn't even get that much information until the procedure was over .<n>i was on hold for maybe 5 minutes when the charge nurse came back and told me my sister was in recovery and that everything had gone good .<n>i was on hold for maybe 5 minutes when the charge nurse came back and told me my sister was in recovery and that everything had gone good .
 Liquid shite runs down my pants and legs, and straight into my shoes .<n>i'm pretty sure it went through both my boxers and my pants, and seeped into the damn car seat .<n>i roll down the window some more so any smell that may have come from what just happened could hopefully ventilate out the window .
 i'm not educated medically, and having severe adhd i quickly forget this.<n> j is a pretty shy guy, even around his friends, and when word got out that he had surgery everybody was questioning him, and he always gave the same answer, \it's hard to explain.\<n> finally, i blurted out \what is it cancer or something? that's why your hairs so sparse right, chemotherapy?\
 while laying on the couch i began redditing on my phone some .<n>my older brother was using my computer late in the night but not unusual as we all tend to be somewhat night owls.<n>then i noticed a strange sound, sort of a rustling. and also the clicks per minute went wayyy down.<n>my brother started clapping my mouse against the desk repeatedly, and then suddenly it was all over.
 i decided to use some of my fine listerine anti-cavity rinse this evening .<n>It had no cap, but lots of our stuff has no cap... so i filled up the dispensing top and let it settle at the appropriate level .<n>i proceeded to spit it out into the virgin white sink. black. lots and lots of black. that isn't sugar my dear, it is m'fing ants!
 My hands slipped off the knife I was using and I accidentally dropped it .<n>The knife sliced the middle of my penis .<n>Thankfully it was a small knife, so i do not have any terribly bad injuries .
 i woke up to go take my early morning shower before work only to see that she was awake, which she never is in the morning when i get up.<n>i don't really think anything of it so i tell her good morning and go to take my shower. fast forward 20 minutes and i'm ready to go to work, and right before i'm about to leave she asks me to cuddle.<n>i think ok why not i have 10 minutes i can spare, i'm one of those who is always early to everything. so i get into the bed and under the covers and low and behold she
 rent was due this weekend. we needed a little extra to cover until next payday .<n>i went to get a payday loan. (i know they are awful but it was necessary.) the teller handed me the cash and i put it in my wallet (along with the money my bf had taken from his account) and then put my wallet in my purse.<n>when i got there, i wanted to make sure i had the cash all facing the same way so that i wouldn't have to fumble with it at the machine.<n>i drove back to the payday loan place and looked in the parking lot.
 \shoe surfing\ is where you hold on to the truck bed and keep your feet on the ground whilst the driver tries to shake you off .<n>i was on for about 3 or 4 minutes, then i feel the worst possible pain ever...in my ass.<n>i look down to see a stick as thick as a stereotypical black man's dick next to me.<n>i put piece by piece together and realized that with my feet so close together and my ass 3 inches from the ground, my feet picked up the black dick stick and wedged it between my asshole and the ground, with

 i was on a move and the lady had a very nice china cabinet.<n>i took out all the china and wrapped it perfectly, next i started wrapping the cabinet with moving blankets. all seemed well and i got my partner to help me pick up the cabinet and move it.<n>well we pick it up and it tilts just a little bit and then we hear a loud crashing noise come from inside the cabinet...<n>open up the cabinet and i forgot to take out the glass shelves. mirrors on the inside busted along with the glass shelves. needless to say the lady was not very happy and we didn't get a
 i went surfing, and as some surfers know, you either bring your keys in the water in your wetsuit, or you toss em in a nearby bush .<n>after doing this hundreds of times in my many years of surfing i thought getting my car stolen would never actually happen .<n>on my way back as stoked as can be my friend who i was with asks me, \gdshred95, where is your car?\<n>i responded \shut up what are you talking about,\ do a double take, and see that my car is in fact gone.

 i was in such a rush to get clean for upcoming activities that i neglected to open the window. this was a huge mistake.<n>i put it down to there being too much steam in the shower box and make to turn and open the shower door - and i slip on something.<n>i'm flat on my naked ass in the corner of the shower box, and my vision's going funny - blotches of colour dancing everywhere, blacking out now and then - and i realise i'm in deep shit.<n>the shower head's still relentlessly beating down on me with hot, steamy water, my

 i had been asleep roughly an hour, when my phone buzzes.<n>i remember this because the only calls i get at 8 am are either collections, or important/emergencies.<n>i see the unknown number and write it off as the former, and just let it go to message and go back to sleep.<n>i woke up properly rested at 10, and realized i had one of those mental sticky notes for myself. \check your phone\ it said.

 My brother is 14. makes it a little worse, doesn't it?<n>i didn't pee outside because i live in maine, and at night, it gets cold enough that my golden stream would freeze as soon as it left my piping.<n>i never thought of peeing in a bottle... but then this all wouldn't have unfolded as it did, and it wouldn't be as funny.
 i shaved my nether regions about 3 days ago, but it caught up with me this morning when i was at work.<n>i made the mistake of using a cheap single blade razor to shave the base of my no-no zone and got a really bad irritation.<n>it started out as a little itching, but eventually became so irritated that it felt like a a cactus was rapidly growing out of my pubes.

 i had stabbed the entire tooth into my cheek, then pulled the comb with such force the tooth bent back and tore my flesh into a 1/4 inch deep tear dropped shaped puncture wound.<n>At least it's only one of many blemishes on my face, and if anything it counter balances the cat scratch on the other cheek.
 i was in the cafeteria with a few friends and i thought it would be funny to screw with them a bit with the salt-shakers.<n>i started off by filling one of my friend's pockets with salt while she was speaking to one half of the group, the other half trying to contain their laughter.<n>i thought it would be funny to pour a bit of salt on another one of my friend's phones as she had unsuspectingly left it on the table, followed up by moderately funny salt puns and playfully mocking her about how crunchy her keys would be.
 i woke up feeling crap, so decided to have a hot bath to see if it helped .<n>i didn\u2019t open the bathroom window because i didn\u2019t want to be cold when i was running the bath and because i haven't learnt the lesson from the previous two times i've nearly fainted after having a hot bath.<n>i hit my leg on a cabinet and now have a very painful bruise in the same position as where my pockets sit, so now i can\u2019t put things in my pocket without being in pain.

 i have a friend who i usually communicated with through a group chat on facebook whose 2-year-old son was just diagnosed with autism.<n>While perusing my reddit feed i saw a greentext story from 4chan, and i love greentext stories.<n>it was the one about the retarded kid trying to pass through the stopped train, while carrying his bike.<n>my friend, not a minute later says \wtf\ i, not thinking, spout out \yeah well that's tards for ya\, remaining oblivious to the fact his son was just diagnosed with autism.
 i was scheduled to go in for 2:45 pm, fill out paperwork and have the interview at 3:00 pm.<n>i arrived at the bank at 2:45 pm, checked in with the receptionist who told me to fill out an application while she checks in with the it department.<n>She then tells me that my appointment was at 2:00 pm, and to fill out the application, and that someone would call me.<n>i went home and checked the laptop i was using to take notes when i called about the positon.<n>on the desktop i had a file, timestamped jun 12, 2013 created @ 11:50am, which

 i'm not entirely sure why, but i do. depending on the day, that reaction will range somewhere on the spectrum between fairly harmless to my very own circle of hell.<n>unfortunately, i haven't been able to figure out why exactly my level of coffee related terribleness varies so much, do drinking coffee is usually an exciting game of digestive tract roulette.

 my housemate and i are also coursemates at uni, and sometimes i'll cook for both of us (no homo) in return for him tutoring me.<n>i was making pork chops with mash potatoes. spuds are done so i go to mash them and they need a little milk to soften...<n>get the milk from the fridge, check the best before (was 2 days within use by date) and pour some in the pan. it was off. not like slightly off either, i'm talking lumpy, vomit inducing yoghurt ruining my hard efforts.<n> managed to scoop all the bad stuff out but broke

 though this happened around three weeks ago, i'll believe this is probably one of my dumbest fuck ups i had ever made.<n> in this game of kickball there were only two bases: home and the wall on the opposite side of the gym.<n> to score all you had to do was kick the ball and run from home to second base (the opposite wall), and back and not get hit with the ball.
 earlier this morning, i had to take a monster dump. it felt like i hadn't crapped in days.<n>i get to school, and immediately headed straight to the restroom. when i arrived, the restroom was cleared.<n>it seemed this crap was destined by the gods, for while i dominated the toilet, no one came in (this could also be from my furious shitting, but either works).<n>the shit was immaculate, and i felt so much lighter afterwards.<n>i went to wipe, and in my favor, the paper was stainless. so much so, i felt i could set it out
 i live on the west coast of Canada, so in my province the legal drinking age is 19 .<n>On my 19th birthday, my girlfriends and i head out to a classy restaurant with a bar vibe, since some of them were still underage and couldn't go to a bar or club .<n>i'm a small (5'2) girl, and was never much of a heavy drinker, so by the 2nd bellini and 2nd shot, i'm good and hammered .<n>i drag my sorry ass out of bed, shower, dress, consume a large glass of water and t

 The roku app has an option of streaming photographs from the phone to the television. you're always two clicks away from this option.<n> somehow, by the gods that organize photos on cell phones, two pictures popped up on the phone.<n>in the dick pic it was pointing toward the camera, like something you might expect to come with 3d glasses. and the one that popped up on the television was the dick.
 kagney linn carter was on the verge of bursting her vocal cords while getting \missionarily\ pummeled by some random, large-dicked male .<n>my speakers were about 75%, and it was very loud and clear.<n>i think she was moaning about how big his dick was, and how much she liked big dicks. she also may have been proclaiming how she was near orgasm.
 my dad had to pay some bills and he asked to use my laptop, i happily obliged, opened my laptop and there, full screen was porn.<n>my dad none the less had a quite different reaction, i guess parents like to pretend their kids never get off, or have access to porn .

 when i spoke to the gf the next day she said she came in and we got our cuddle on and then she left me asleep in my bed....and then i spoke to my mom.<n> apparently, throughout the course of the night, i unleashed the full force of my pale hairy body and climbed into bed with my dad.<n>He was awoken by the clumsy attempt to get comfortable, and proceeded to ask me what the actual fuck i was doing and ordered me to go to bed.
 time trial is a race against the clock, no drafting other people, go at your own pace by yourself.<n>there is a 1 minute gap between every rider at the start, so to catch someone your time would have to be 1 minute faster than theirs.<n>the course is an idyllic 10 km (6 mile) seaside loop, around which you do 2 laps. mostly very close to flat, except for one short uphill section.
 My mom called a teacher from my old elementary to talk to me about being gay .<n>The teacher is gay, he is probably the only gay person my mom knows .<n>My mom thought that the only way i would be so interested in that kind of thing is if i were gay myself .
 i went to the beach with some friends. everything was chill and as expected.<n>i, personally, hate going into the water. the idea of bacteria and fishy fecal matter makes me cringe.<n>i woke up and my arms are littered in blisters, they are radiating intense heat, and are so bright red you could direct traffic with them.<n>i will be missing about 4 days of work and approximately $177.67 worth of payment.

 i've recently been having random bouts of sleepwalking. at least i think that's what it is.<n>it's happened three or four times in the past six months or so.<n>i sleep in my underwear and no shirt usually, but i remember my sleep-self thinking that i was only going to go check on whatever it was that i needed to since it would be quick and so i wouldn't have to bother putting pants on.
 i woke up to go to a friends house and began to back down my driveway, when my car makes an awful, just absolutely horrible screeching and grinding sound .<n>after about an hour of waiting, they inform me that i have about $2000 dollars worth of repairs to be done on my car .<n>Now i need to fix my transmission, alignment, sway bar, and a variety of other small fixes for which i do not have the money for .
 this wasn't actually today, couple of years back (17 at the time) but still, i feel you should all know and laugh!<n>as i was underage i couldn't go to the shop and buy some beer so i had to scout around the house to find some sufficient alcohol.<n>i stumble upon an un-opened liter bottle of jd. jackpot!<n>by the time the bus had arrived, i had already consumed a good 1/4 of the bottle.<n>i then decide it's a good idea to go and sit outside, stark bollock naked, and have a cig.
 recently my headset stopped working so i have been using earbuds to listen to games and videos on my computer .<n>i wanted to watch a movie on netflix and having no speakers other than the earbuds i decided to move my computer closer to my bed so i could lay in it an watch the movie .<n>my desk is a glass desk and my computer case has rubber feet .<n>the one slight inch or two killed my computer. it blue screened and restarted so i just turned it off and went to bed.<n>i woke up this morning and turned it on. it brought up a screen called startup repair. i sat
 i left the window to my second story bedroom window wide open with the light on. coming in from my roof i notice a few flies in my room.<n>my bedroom light acted as a beacon for over 500 flies and they were swarming on the ceiling like some classic horror movie shit.<n>i noped the hell out of there and after an hour and burnt out vacuum belt i finally got the situation under control. happy fourth every one.
 i was friendly at work with managers in another department who were still technically supervisors to me. this meant no fraternization because to them i was \staff\ even though we are close in age.<n>After i gave my two weeks one of the managers and i are in private and he says to me, \ good thing about you not working here anymore is now we can *talk*...\ i was caught off guard and laughed it off, but i was flattered.<n>He said he just wanted to talk, and talk he does. he claims his wife doesn't want to hear about his day blah blah blah, just

 pear bounced off the ceiling and hit a couple other objects before landing unceremoniously on the ground .<n>blue coloured cleaner and a white ceiling aren't best of friends .<n>since it was just a white ceiling, i thought that since it was just a white ceiling, i could paint over the spot with some white paint that they had left over after finishing the house .<n>what i didn't know was that the ceiling was done with a matte finish while the paint i was using was a semi-gloss finish .

 i've been bulimic for a while and in order to hide the teeth marks, i tried to use other instruments to trigger my gagging .<n>One day i waited for my roommate to go to class so i could do it and went about my routine, swallowed a little bit and thought nothing of it .<n>i stood there in shock for a second as i gasped and grabbed my throat, but i could breathe.<n>i was so scared, i rushed for my toothbrush and started shoving it down there to try and throw the tampon back up and i ended up with a mess of vomit and blood all over my

 we had a nice dinner, but all throughout the meal she was being very flirty and playful in an erotic sort of way .<n> let's just say ol' willy got a rise out of all the attention. cut to the end of the meal. we paid for the meal and walked out the door.<n>then, suddenly, it happened: my shorts just slid down my legs on their own volition, **right as new customers were approaching the front door.** private johnson was still at attention at this point, but thankfully it was dark enough that nobody noticed.
 i'm a lot more sensitive to prescription drugs, so painkillers make me hallucinate .<n>i sit at my desk, and my keyboard starts melting. or so that's what i thought .<n>my laptop grew a face and began yelling at me. turns out the laptop wasn't yelling, it was my boss.<n>my boss promptly called security and i was tackled out of my chair. that was the last thing i remembered .

 My sink had been leaking, or rather, had a slight drip when off for a few months.<n>i decided i'd like to fix it. read a bunch of articles on it, went to home depot, and got me a replacement knob and o-rings.<n>every article mentioned \turning the water supply off.\ try as i might, the valves underneath my sink just wouldn't turn. it seems they were rusted shut.<n>where my hot water knob used to be, an insane geyser. it's shooting 6+ feet up to the ceiling.<n>i immediately drop to the floor to try and get
 i was laying in bed and my toenail on my toe next to my pinky on my left foot was getting snagged in my blanket cause it had a slight hangnail.<n>As soon as i begin, before there is ever a chance for correction, the nail goes on a straight downward angle and i'm stuck with it peeled halfway down and left in searing pain.<n>i then promptly cringed my teeth as hard as humanly possible and quickly tore off the whole thing.
 this actually happened when i was around 8 or 9 so this is more of a 6yaifu.<n>i was really sick with a fever and a bad cold and i didn't know what diarrhea was and i didn't know i had it.
 i went out for a run, and i came back and just went straight to the small couch of my flat and started doing **it**.<n>in a panic, my arm hit the wall and i could instantly feel that it was broken, or at least something was wrong.<n>i tried to shout or say something like go away, but it was my step-sister who had a key to the house, and in a panic with my arm still in my pants and one arm broken/shattered, i instantly stood up and tripped over my own pants that was down at my ankles, falling down and breaking my nose

 i went to a crawfish boil/bbq this weekend and ended up falling down into a pile of wood to be burned .<n>fast forward to Monday when i began to notice that some of the scrapes are becoming itchy and inflamed.<n>i also begin to notice what i believe to be red bug/chigger bites on my genitals.<n>i honestly think that if i had literally torched my genitals they would have burned less.<n>i am now on the couch naked with a cold rag on my fire engine red testicles, nauseous from the pain, hoping beyond hope that this will subside soon.
 i was working on a project, and i had just gotten access to the git repository (so no files were yet committed)<n>i did a git add *before* adding a .gitignore for the project. by doing so, i had checked in the wrong files.<n>but i thought, no big deal, ill just add a git ignore, unstage the changes, and re-stage them, right?<n>so i added the gitignore, and here's where i made the mistake. instead of using \git reset *\, i used \git rm -r *\.

 This girl and i have become friends this past semester, as we are in the same class and sit together every day.<n>i don't know everything about her, but still, i feel like an asshole for what happened earlier.<n>so we agreed to meet in the library to get some work done together, and she was already there when i was coming in.<n>i found where she was (i'm approaching from behind) and thought it would a great freaking idea if I went up and gently patted her on the shoulder to let her know I was there.<n>she let out a huge shriek, alerting

 i am a distance runner but we have to play football to get a grade.<n>just playing, i slip right on my behind about five feet and hurt my left wrist. no big deal, just walked it off.<n>the x- ray at this point has confirmed my collarbone is broken, so they get this medieval torture device that will hold my shoulder in place. nearly pass out.<n>i also got a wrist brace and a sling for my right arm when i am up and about. it seems to be healing but going to the restroom, showering, washing my hands, eating, taking a dump (is extremely agonizing),
 i'm currently a senior in college and have only had one serious girlfiend in that time .<n>i'm shy, i'm kind of an asshole, i can never take a hint, i always assume the girl likes someone else .<n>last weekend, i invited her over to my place to watch some movies and drink some wine together. she says it sounds like a good idea and comes over .<n>we proceed to talk about how our romantic lives are shitty and how we just haven't been able to find the perfect person yet even though we've been trying .
 i came across a baby turtle that had somehow flipped over in the middle of the fairway .<n>i drop him 2-3 feet off of a small bridge into the water, small tears coming from my eyes, and wish the little guy the best of luck in his new life .<n>after a couple of minutes, his shell turns upside down, and sinks to the bottom .
 i bought a pocket hose, because i *am* a lady who does not enjoy lugging 50 pounds of garden hose around the fucking yard .<n> anyway, i figured this would take all of 5 minutes and since the patch is close to the back door of my house, i didn't bother putting a bra on beneath my white t-shirt .<n>i turned on the water, raised the hose, hit the lever... and the connector for the sprayer nozzle immediately rocketed off into space .

 he asked me to be his boyfriend. eventually, i turned him down.<n>after all of this, he asked me an unrelated question.<n>i intended on finding out the answer, and so i intended to respond with the phrase \one sec.\ so, apparently, android doesn't recognize \sec\ as an adequate phrase.<n>but in its mind, a proper replacement would be the word \sex.\

 i'm working on transferring apps/data from my uncle's (nigerian) galaxy tab 10.1, to his new galaxy tab 2 10.1. all of a sudden, his strong urge to take a shit hits me .<n>i get up and run to the nearest bathroom. little did i know the repairman had been working on stuff in the bathroom, so the toilet was messy and dirty as fuck .<n>i knew that i had to take a massive, urgent shit, i valued my health too much so i booked it to the upstairs bathroom .
 i was camping with a group of kids and adults from my church's scout group.<n>we were going to be rafting the river and just having fun for a few days.<n>well, the first day we got to camp we had nothing to do in the afternoon, so we decided to make a rope swing.<n>well, at the time, all the kids were 16-18 and the adults were in their 30s. we had just enough common sense to make a swing on a large branch and not some spindly thing.<n>the branch we picked had a diameter of about 12 inches so we figured it could hold our
 i had just finished making some late-night munchies in the form of pot-stickers (the idea sounded brilliant considering previous activities) and reached across the stove to reach a pack of soy sauce i put across the way.<n>i reached across the stove. with a lack of a shirt.<n>According to gabriel iglesias, i'm somewhere between husky and fluffy. either way, the protective covering for the abs did its job...at the cost of me now holding an ice pack up to my gut.
 i was sitting at my desk earlier this afternoon, redditing away, with a nice, tall glass of grapefruit juice on the little pullout-table thing that my desk has .<n>As i absentmindedly reached for my glass of juice without looking at it, it spilled all over my floor, and my netbook .<n>i looked up a youtube video on how to tear down the netbook and did so, wiping what i could and blowing off the rest with canned air .
 i was bored that day and kinda good at graphic design, so that's what i did .<n>i succeeded, and sent him the link to the picture. however, i didn't tell him that it was a joke. as it turns out, he didn't even look at the banner and just immediately saved the link .
 i forgot to lock the bathroom door. not that it mattered, no one was home .<n>my mom walked in on me holding the shower head to my clit. she screams and turns around awkwardly while i panic; instead of turning the shower off, i turn it to the hottest setting there is.<n>\my fucking vagina!!!\** echoes from the shower, down the hall, around the corner and into my mother's already damaged head. so, here i am, holding a freezing cold wash cloth on my clit while dying from embarrassment waiting for my mother to get home from her manicure.
 i went to a Halloween party that my college was throwing. it was fun and all seeing my friends in their costumes and stuff, but it was *super* boring there cause, you know, it was being thrown by the school.<n>One of the girls with us, suzy, was obviously into me, making a point to sit next to me while we waited for the others, laughing at my dumb jokes, all that.<n>for the last 40 minutes i've been making out with a severely drunk girl while i've been totally sober.<n>i was amazed at how sober she had seemed while inside the house
 i started to wash my face when i notice my girlfriend left a bottle of what looks like face wash .<n>i was in a rush and out of face wash so i completely missed the vagina bit.<n>i was in a rush and out of face wash so i completely missed the vagina bit.
 i needed a new laptop. the one i was using was very old and beaten to hell.<n>i'm saying i can turn it on and get it to a screen that tells me to hit f11 and then sends me to a point where i can recover files and after all that restart the computer and then it goes in a complete circle.<n>this computer is basically as useless to me as the stationary laptop outside.
 i showed my 7 year old son my old music collection.<n>i started with some 90s techno and he liked it.<n>i then asked him: \did you know that music can even scare you?\<n>he did not believe me so i started aphex twin - come to daddy. he sat in his seat and was getting smaller and smaller until he cried.
 i brought my computer with me to a debate tournament because i would usually read my speeches off of my computer, and i was tethering through my phone for internet because the school the tournament was in had a wifi password.<n>While we wait between rounds in the school auditorium the coach wants to use my computer for a few minutes to check on the website postings.<n>i was too engaged in trying to figure out what the hell had happened to realize that the sound was on, and the videos were all *playing*, and my sound was on.<n>i slammed my computer shut as soon as i realized, and people in the
 as part of my job at a restaurant, i have to clean the large glass doors at the entrance of the place. they get really nasty from all of the hands that push on the glass to open it, so they have to be sprayed down from time to time.<n>i spray down the doors real good, then i reach backwards. huh, the door is back farther than i thought it was.<n>my stupid brain doesn't realize it's not a door. as i keep reaching back at this \door,\ i notice that some of my fellow workers are giving me horrified looks.
 anyways i was walking to the bus stop(driving test next week.) and waiting for the bus.<n>i got on and i felt something wrong. kinda like a motion sickness kinda way.<n>as i approached the door, i felt like I needed to fart. so i proceed to do so.<n>i froze, i'm 3 inches from the door way to my class. it felt lukewarm. the texture felt like the cross between water and dijon mustard.<n>i just washed it and using 2 cups of detergent and 5 sheets of softener sheets before shitting in it. so the glade smell is
 The night before the wedding me and my bestman went to our local small pub to have a couple of pints.<n>The party itself was also so great, even though i feared beforehand that i'd get too drunk at my own wedding.<n>When the taxi arrived to our hotel, nobody could wake me up, so my now-wife just stood there and laughed her pretty little ass of while our friends, four of them, carried me to our suite.<n>They even tried to take off my suit, but eventually gave up and went to their own rooms.
 a few years ago, my school ran a foreign exchange program.<n>some students from a fairly wealthy suburb of barcelona came to stay with families where i live for a week and we went over there later on in the year.<n>the student i was paired with was a quiet kid who seemed really shy. (understandable in a foreign country where no-one speaks your first language.)<n>a few days into the week, me and a friend were having an argument. a few days into the week, me and a friend were having an argument. a few days into the week, me and a friend were having an
 after the blowjob fest in the back of my car, the only way to clean up was to use these napkins i found in the back seat.<n>i wiped us up and found a little empty bag of pork rinds that i stuck the cum wipes in.<n>on the way home, she finds the bag of pork rinds and starts digging through it picking up the napkins telling me to not put my \snotty tissues\ into a potato chip bag.
 when i closed out the tab, the tab with the comic appears on the screen.<n>i tried to explain to him that it is a comic strip and the creator also does porn every so often, i am certain that he did not believe me. word travels fast here and everyone now thinks that i look at hentai.
 i woke up hours later, freezing in the tub, where i apparently spilled most of a handle of jack daniels and soaked in it for two hours .<n>i called the interviewer's office (after hours at this point) and said i was really sick and needed to reschedule and emailed the same thing. fortunately in the morning they said that was fine.
 my mom asked me to go outside and start up the grill so we could have hot dogs and hamburgers for dinner.<n>So i start the grill then put the stuff on the grill and look in the corner and saw some older golf clubs.<n>i grab some iron and go to the lawn and start swinging it.<n>i though why don't i just take an old golf ball and hit it into the field. so i grab my dads driver out of his back because i don't want to go into the basement to get mine.
 i am not at my best mental capacity at 7:30 in the morning .<n>my period had started. no big deal, i'd just run to the bathroom that wasn't far from my room and get a pad, right? right?<n>when i stood up, the floodgates opened.<n>i speedwalked to the bathroom (i don't know why i didn't run, again, i am not at my best) but halfway there it appeared this would not be adequate .
 i'm a big fan of tf2, clocking in over several hundred hours of playtime when i've got nothing to do .<n>when the balloonicorn came out as a product on the valve store and thinkgeek, i knew i had to get one .<n>my dad is a very christian man and thinks that homosexuality (or even guys liking things that have a bit of a feminine touch besides women themselves) is a sin .
 i was tired, the cat is overweight and asks for more food three times a day so i thought she could wait until morning.<n>this morning i found cat food all around our washing machine as our cat decided to help herself, i cleaned it and fed the cat.<n>after about 15 minutes the fire alarm goes of.<n>i then run around like a chicken with no head and check al the smoke detectors downstairs but non of them had a red light.<n>i then leave the fire extinguisher downstairs as fire does not seem to be the problem, and get upstairs again to find out water comes from the attic and leaks into a
 last night we had a bit of a splash that involved each of us drinking a six-pack immediately prior to going to bed.<n>i woke up at my usual time and realized i had to pee immediately.<n>i tried to be all zen and focus on other things, emptying my mind like i wanted to empty my bladder, but i could feel my belly as firm as a basketball, and my urethra was all like, \duuuude, wtf, i can not hold this flood back\
 i had to turn down sex with the bf because it was hurting enough. it usually just gets inflamed and hurts a bit, but it wasn't feeling right. fast-forward to this morning, i wake up earlier than him and in my sleepy stupor wander downstairs.<n>before i know it, i'm incredibly horny, and completely forgetting about last night, start going to town.<n>with 2 minutes, my dick is on fire. i can hardly stand the pain. the fiery wrath of satan came down upon my genitalia this morning, and even now, 4 hours later, it still hurts
 my mom made vegetarian burritos last night with veggie crumbles and pintos .<n>When dinner was over, everyone in the house was boated and gassy .<n>my dad conceded defeat for the first time in all of my years, but it was not to last .<n>my mom, somehow knowing what she had planned, put her hands on my ass to push it out of her face .
 stormy the cat was at the foot of the bed and i wanted to pet him; so i pet him with my foot. suddenly, my wife looks over and says \babe, what are you doing? you're rubbing stormy's butt\
 after working in the shop all day i was hot and thirsty .<n>well sitting in the cup holders of my truck is two bottles, one is a spitter for chew and the other is tea from lunch, both in the same style bottle .<n>i was so thirsty i didn't pay attention to which bottle i grabbed.<n>i grabbed the spitter and took a big swig of it. instantaneous nausea.
 i'm a sophomore in college and people have just started moving in.<n>i've also been in contact with a girl over the summer and we hook up sometimes.<n>i invited all my friends from last year to come(including the girl) and it is going well.<n>a different female friend of mine tells me the rest. she asks me to take her back to her dorm cuz she's bored.<n>i also agree because i notice summer-girl leaving the party as well and it is in the same direction.<n>i then re-lose consciousness, and wake up at 9:30 am almost naked on my
 we just had our one year anniversary, but things were not well for us .<n>she just started a new job and we haven't seen each other as much as we used to .
 stupid stupid me decided to wear a pear of loose shorts because it's still fairly hot out.<n>i've never worn a buttplug out without wearing jeans or yoga pants. guess it was those, not my clenching skills, that typically held the plug in place.
 i hop on the 'ole Xbox and launch the first game that catches my eye in my half-assed collection: call of duty black ops ii.<n>i'm a notoriously loud serial rager, and have one helluva potty mouth to boot.<n>next thing i know, jimmy quickscopes comes up and gats me, causing me to scream a hearty, \fucking faggot!\ into my mic.
 they bought the gift last Saturday, but i finally saw my mom today to give her the gift.<n>my mom opens the box to find a lovely snow globe for grandmothers. she goes \ooh, that's very pretty\ and then realizes it plays music.<n>i told her that it played \wind beneath my wings\ and she looked as though she was going to cry and said quietly that it was my aunt's favorite song.
 Some of my crushes friends have been cracking a few wise-ass jokes, not targeting anyone in particular, but m seems to think it is directed to her and her friends .<n>The problem is as follows: some of my crushes friends have been cracking a few wise-ass jokes, not targeting anyone in particular, but m seems to think it is directed to her and her friends .
 during my break i got on reddit and was browsing around when i felt the need to fap, well, i'm weird and i was just looking around on r/hentai when i found this really good picture of one of my favorite anime characters in a...well... indecent...position.<n>well my sister and my dad both walked by my room with this picture enlarged on my screen.<n>well my sister and my dad both walked by my room with this picture enlarged on my screen.<n>i being oblivious to this fact continued on like everything was normal, until they had left i and was done with class and
 i was in my english class having a casual conversation when all the sudden my teacher gave my class some concerning news regarding her pregnancy .<n> upon hearing the semi-shitty news, i just said without thinking, \abort the mission!\
 before i woke up, i had a bj dream (happens on occasion, never results in the following)... now we chat and she leaves for school, so i fall asleep again to the same dream.<n>my brain, being the horny teen brain it is, decides to escalate the dream a bit further to a full on sex dream.<n>and the dream... escapes the mind and shoots into reality... shoots it right into my favorite boxers... i wake up to a very good feeling and a hard boner. then i realized that that feeling was an orgasm. the damage was devastating.
 when we first found out i cleaned my apartment and made sure it was ready for them to run.<n> we then had a meeting and the landlord told us that we would have a door hanger telling us two days before anyone would be in our apartments.<n> today i came home to find my and all my neighbors doors wide open with dudes running from one room to another.
 on the way home, my car (which was pushing 100k miles) started really struggling to accelerate. it wouldn't go above 40-45 mph, even when i pushed the pedal as hard as i could.<n>After borrowing even more money, i took my car to get a basic fluid change, hoping the issue was transmission fluid or something.<n>well, the fuel filter in a scion can only be changed by ripping out the whole seat, so off to the dealership we go. $320 and a new fuel filter later.
 i had taken the top off for the summer, but the driver and passenger front side window halfs of the doors were still on it.<n>i went to open the driver's side door and it just wouldn't budge.<n>i explained the situation and he proceeds to try to get it open for himself, and of course, can't do it.<n>i could have said \fuck it\ and gone about my day, but no, you see, i am a mechanical engineering student.
 my dick pisses right through the tiny gap between the toilet seat and bowl, spraying the back of my khakis and the floor .<n>i do my best to clean up and dry everything off, but there's still a noticeable dark spot smack dab in the middle of my ass .<n>i live too far away to go change, have no backup pants here, and no easy way to disappear and clean them .
 i'm a sixteen year old kid working 30+ hours a week and going to school everyday.<n>Recently my friend said that i should smoke during lunch to de-stress and everything would be fine and that i just needed a break.<n>When i get back from lunch after smoking a few bowls with a group of close friends, i start feeling it alllllll away.<n>we were using the school computers and this kid in the class before ours left his account logged in.<n>One of my buddies tells me that it is this kid who tried to sleep with my girlfriend and who was talking shit about me.<n>
 my teacher made me take the pest home. my parents also hated the so called animal, and made me keep it in my room.<n> each week my teacher expects us to take home the class pet, a hamster, for the day.<n>Today at school, i brought it in the class and told everyone that it died in his sleep. some girls actually started crying and the teacher was ready to take the day off.<n>my teacher, thinking i was upset and suffering from some kind of pts asked me to be the one with the honour of buring it and talking about its last few hours of life.
 i am the one who usually says random things to see peoples reaction (not to hurt anyone's feelings)<n>i come up with the genius idea of going halfway across the room and sitting at the teachers table and saying i want to be a hitman or assassin.<n>She says why and i say because my name implies it and she says \then you should be a butcher\. then i say \no it means mass murder and that's what assassins do\<n>i don't think i will be able to stay in school because i said this when tensions in the country are high.
 koi pond in our new house had not been well maintained in the last year .<n>We decided to clean it out and fix it up, as it hadn't been well maintained in the last year before we moved in .<n>We kept the water from the pond in the bucket and all the fish were fine (about a dozen or so fish.)<n>Fast forward to today (well technically yesterday but i didn't get a chance to post this then) and i come home from work and my dad comes over to measure the pond .<n>he then yells out to me, \hey! all the
 [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bf-8uc07pu) made me take a poop on myself and i ruined my favorite boxers .
 mac and cheese exploded out of my ass and caused me to projectile vomit so hard that the chunks ricocheted back up to hit me in the face .<n>i cleaned up, went into the kitchen to get some water, and wandered past my roommates and into bed. it took maybe three sips of water before my stomach revolted again, and i went into the bathroom to puke some more. currently i'm sitting on the bathroom floor trying to see if it's feasible to even sleep in my bed tonight.
 The lights in the kitchen exploded! they shook the room with the power of an angry god.<n> shards of glass bounced from counter to cupboard and some into the toaster!<n>i had no lights, no lamps, not even the glow of the microwave clock that taunts me daily with its time traveling power!
 i'm not starting my lab placement until may, but i happen to work in the same building as his team .<n>My supervisor-to-be thought it would be a good idea for me to attend their weekly meetings if i was available .
 last night i packed up my headphones in my backpack for classes the next day, as i always forget them at home and sit on campus in silence.<n> upon moving them to my pocket they fell on the ground in the case they came in.<n>i turn around to retrieve them, and they were gone.
 He moans in the fashion that i know it's my turn to help him - thermo-style.<n>i take his dick and slide the thermometer in way too fast and way too aggressively...over, and over again.<n>due to both of our intoxication levels, i couldn't read his pain and he couldn't read my pleasure...leading to a 43 year old man screaming like a 16 year old girl...and not in a fun way.
 i'm lazy, even for a seventeen year old, so i just got a large can of sweetcorn, a spoon, added salt and spent the afternoon slowly eating it .<n>the day after, i had to be up at four am to catch a coach to birmingham to play in a concert, along with several other youth orchestras from around the country .<n>i hadn't pooped for something like eleven hours after eating the corn, plus at least another 3 or 4 hours before i ate the corn, but i was running late so i had to pinch it back and soldier on to catch the
 when i was about five my parents thought it'd be good to bring my younger sister and me to church to see if we liked it.<n>it was one of those churches where they do a fair bit of singing and put their hands up in the air.<n>i'm getting a bit confused as to why people are putting their hands up, so i ask my dad. he doesn't know why, but he tells me that they're trying to get closer to god.
 i'm still amazed that he kept laughing through the whole thing.<n>the entirety of the eruption was on myself.<n>i wouldn't say that my beard is \magnificent,\ but i would say that it rivals many of my friends' beards.
 one of the regulars comes in (let's call him dummy) and sees the sauces. he immediately starts bragging about how he can handle any sauce and how he's drunk several different kinds before.<n>lucky for dummy we manage to talk him down from actually drinking the stuff and convince him to just use the eye dropper.<n>Within a few seconds there are tears running down his face, his eyes are red and he's making very strange noises.
 The guitar pick fell through my shirt, and into my pants .<n>It got stuck in my underwear and decided to lodge itself into my asscrack .<n>My most upvoted post ever is a self post about getting a guitar pick stuck in my ass .
 today is my birthday was headed out to get food with the wife and some friends, got to the restaurant and we found a 20$ bill on the ground .<n>Turned out when i got home, that it must have been my 20 bucks, and that the other 80 i had plus a 30 dollar check from my grandparents, is missing .
 My girlfriend and I went to the beach for 3 days during our sophomore year of high school .<n>like the responsible honor students we all were, we brought booze and weed with us .<n>After a solid week of no sex, i take my gf, run back to the spot, and fuck every last inch of her .
 my boyfriend's parents live quite close to me, so they'd obviously seen smoke in the direction of my road and asked someone if they knew what was going on .<n> turns out the fire was in one of the flats along the high street, someone had left the gas on and set their place on fire - nasty stuff .<n> this fire reminded me of a time in our previous flat, when my boyfriend had left the hob on, and i had come home to a smoke filled flat and burn marks on the wooden surfaces around the oven .
 zyklon.b looks like laughing gas compared to what i'm packing .<n>i mean.... clogging the toilet with it's circumference while the molten core violently explodes leaving a fecal volcano in it's wake .<n> note that the entire time this was processing she had begun to projectile vomit from what i can only imagine was the stench of the gas used in nazi concentration camps .
 they're engaged and i've been in a relationship for over a year. neither of us expected anything but things spiraled out of control through some of our conversations.<n>the problem is, i can't do anything with my so without picturing them instead and it's driving me crazy.
 my eldest needed to replace his eyeglasses and i decided since he was home already, we should do it today.<n>the initial plan was to get my father in law to take us (my sons and me) that fell through.<n>that was a no go. that should have ended my planning but once i get an idea in my head, i become compulsive.<n>my wife should have just told me to go to hell and i would have grumbled for awhile. but apparently, she loves me and knows how miserable i get when can't do something i think i need to do.
 woke up this morning at 5, went to the gym. started doing cardio again and was very very sweaty. finish 15 mins before class starts.<n>\lets lube my legs with axe!\ proceed to spray axe on my balls. felt like i touched the wrath of millions of chili peppers and touched my junk.<n> stuck in an almost naked fetal position in the change room washroom. make orgasm noises as i roll around in pain.<n>people come in to try and help but leave when the sight of a almost fully naked guy with his hands in his underwear making orgy noises appears in front of them.
 i was riding to my friends on my relatively heavy jump bike, and i have to go down a steep hill with a bridge for trains that goes over the top with enough room for a car.<n>well, i didn't pay any attention to the cars oncoming and i just threw a burst of energy in to peddling and maxed out (quite small rear sprocket so it was easy) and me being an idiot i had only tightened my front brakes, and, you bikers out there know what that means....<n>if you pull that brake at speed it will send you flying, so i only have one brake and i have to
 i met this girl who seemed like she was really into me, fucking crazy. she is very sexual and all of the cool shit most girls aren't.<n> since my last relationship went to fucking shit i haven't really given a shit about anyone since and i kinda approached this girl the same way, like just being me no pretending bullshit.<n>After the few days i've known her(almost a week) i actually really like her and i think i let it show too much and she might be slowly backing away.
 i got up from my desk to stretch due to my post lunch coma.<n>as i squatted down with one leg out my pants split from the top of my ass all the way down to my balls. it wasn't even a clean rip.<n>i sat down at my desk and couldn't stop laughing and my face turned bright red.<n>many thoughts came to my head as to how to get the hell outta my office without anyone noticing.
 i've known a friend since i was a kid. we're both older now, and more.mature, or so i thought.<n>up until i got into contact with him this past winter, we hadn't spoke since sophomore year or high school, which is 5 years ago.<n>He became a major racist. not a \racist,\, a full blown racist.<n>Every time he saw a black person he would turn to me and say \oh god more of them..\ or \oh fuck another black guy\
 when i was taking a shower today i'd left my clean pants on the floor of the bathroom. once done with my showering, i get out, dry off, and put my clothes on.<n>everything is proceeding as expected when i suddenly feel something crawling about in the crotch of my pants. naturally, i rip my pants off whilst silently screaming and wishing i were dead.<n>right before my eyes one of the more massive spiders i have ever seen crawls out of my pants and goes on its merry way while i hyperventilate and contemplate taking a second shower.
 i have been waxing the cyclops in the shower everyday, using your basic shampoo as a lubricant .<n>the shampoo had dried out only the tip of my dick, with drastic results .<n>my tip is basically white, not like a white guy, but straight up white on a color wheel, with bloody canyons mixed in .
 This kid has some mental illnesses, part of it has to do with filtering things in social situations.<n> when we were learning about good study skills, he was asked where he gets his homework done.<n>he responds saying something like, \oh, i do it everywhere! sometimes i'll do it in the kitchen, sometimes at my desk, even sometimes on my bed!\<n>i was focused on how to stop giggling to stop from getting in trouble, as apparently i was the only one who found that funny.
 i was at a friend's birthday party, and we were all just hanging out playing some guitar .<n>my turn comes, and i start off with wonderwall, bitches love wonderwall .<n>i finish up, and this 9/10 gets up real close to me, looks into my eyes, and in the most flirtatious fucking voice i've ever heard asks, \so like, how do you play guitar?\
 i realize that his appleid is still active on this phone and \photoshare\ or \photostream\ or whatever is on.<n>this means any photo saved to the phone is automatically uploaded to his icloud and any other connected devices.<n>my stomach dropped and i feel nauseous. but he's also tech-tarded and i don't know if this pic is a ticking time-bomb laying in wait in his phone/computer's photostream.
 Amsterdam is besides their liberal policy on soft drugs infamous for its red light district .<n>Since me and my friends are not really into smoking weed, we just gotterribly wasted .<n>i went for a piss and stood infront of the urinal, packed out and let go .
 at my uni, we're given toilet paper weekly, but it's really cheap and scratchy. fair enough, it's free, but it still makes wiping a tad uncomfortable sometimes.
 my friend left the lounge room and walked towards the toilet and fell over grabbing a urn which was my grandmothers onto the ground .<n>my friend left the lounge room and walked towards the toilet and fell over grabbing a urn which was my grandmothers onto the ground .<n>we cleaned the house up as best we could and haven't told my grandfather what happened with the urn yet .
 i was driving home from my mate's house, when this woman walks out in front of my car, sobbing hysterically and begging me to help her .<n>She said she just needed to get to home, which was in a suburb just around the corner .<n>Within 10 seconds of being in a confined space with her, the stench of booze wafting off her hit me like a sledgehammer .<n>She saw this, called me a liar and tried to snatch it, but in her inebriated state her hand-eye co-ordination was sorely lacking .
 i'm chillin at home playing some settlers of catan with the family, and i excuse myself to go drop the kids off at the the pool.<n>While i'm deploying the navy seals, having a pleasant time thank you very much, just doing my business, everything goes according to plan albeit a bit wet.<n>i go to wipe my bottom clean and i notice that the toilet paper is red. bloody fucking red. no mess, no bad cleanup, just red. it didn't even hurt.
 ky warming gel doesn't seem to have much of a warming sensation for me .<n>It's probably about 90 seconds later that she's in my bathroom shouting \it won't stop burning\ and climbing into my shower .<n>i used to think i was just an asshole as a security measure against the general public, because i don't like most of you flesh bags most of the time .
 i felt a sharp pain shoot up from my left thumb .<n>while talking, i continued dicing and had added the tip of the digit to the potatoes for that extra kick .<n>the cutting board was covered in an astounding amount of jack daniels ridden blood .<n>there on the board was the piece of the thumb, complete with a tiny clipping of the nail .
 as i take one off the rack, i feel a tickle on my nose and feel a sneeze coming on.<n>i decide to itch my nose with my shoulder, and as i do, fan out the bag with my hands to open it.<n>because of this quick action, my shoulder decides to jump up directly into my nose, more or less punching myself in the face.<n>there was blood everywhere on me, the didn't let me go home.
 i've always heard the axiom of \never trust a fart when you have the flu\, but i ignored the facts and experiences from my past fallen comrades.<n> trying to save face, i changed my sheets, bedspread, and flipped the mattress.<n>for future poop-proofing i decided to remove my shower curtain and use it as a safety shield because fuck it.

 Today i toured the campus of my new school with the worst case of mud butt i've had since i was in diapers.<n>The bathroom was silent so i knew when i started wiping the stranger would hear it.<n>i tried to time the wipe with the toilet flushing but there was a problem with the motion sensor so i had to hit this button with the same hand i was wiping with because the other hand was holding my shirt out of the way of my ass.

 my dad works in a hospital and there is no excuse for being late unless it's something like a car accident, death in family, etc.<n>My dad shows up to work two hours late, gets humiliated by his supervisor, and almost fired. luckily, he was given a first warning because he never shows up late.
 even though his car's in the shop, i borrow my dad's in order to work. go in midday, slow only 2 deliveries, then the third one comes.<n>the third delivery's alil heavy, and wet on the bottom, but i think nothing of it, have delivered before and it wasn't that heavy or wet.<n>the soups all explode getting fucking everywhere. my cup holders became won ton baths for my phone.
 my boyfriend and i had been hanging out, and we were starting to get very affectionate - in a way that remaining outside was probably going to get us some trouble .<n>he suggested that we go to his brother's house. keeping in mind that his brother and sister-in-law were moving out and the doors were locked with the keys inside.<n>for the last month or so we've been waiting for an opportunity to shower together, and with the water still on in the locked and mostly empty house, we jumped on it.
 i've used a pump cart before, but for some reason i thought this one defied the laws of gravity .<n>the cart picked up momentum about a quarter of the way down the ramp and i knew it was going to take me with it, so i jumped out of the way .<n>Thankfully, only muscle damage. no tendon damage, no broken bones, and didn't tear the artery near my ankle .
 i just finished school up (i'm on the quarter system) and came back home.<n>seeing as i recently graduated, people kept buying me drinks.<n>well this one hot girl starts flirting with me, and telling me i'm cute. we start to talk, and she tells me she owns a furniture store in downtown. then she tells me we can check it out later.<n>However, she insists i buy beer at the 7-11 next to her place. we go into the furniture shop, and proceed to drink beers.<n>i wake up in the morning to discover i pissed myself on one of her show
 i have been in this apartment for two years now. when i moved in, the owners lived nearby.<n>it is a 'no pets' lane of apartments but there was cat food we had to clean out from under the oven when i moved in, and cats further down the row of apartments, so about six months in i asked if i could get a cat.<n>they said okay, so i got a signed paper from them to send to the local adoption agency ('local' meaning two hours away) and got myself a ridiculously spoiled indoor-only cat.<n> since then, the apartment row has been transferred to the
 last year i lost a bunch of weight, and like most- this year i'm well on the way to gaining it back.<n>in an effort to lose the 25 lbs that i gained, i decided to start the same regimen i did last year by going on a several mike long walk/jog in my toe shoes.<n>6 miles in i notice that one of my toes starts to hurt and so i turn around and jog the 6 miles back, checking my toe for damage when i get home. it's fine, not even raw. so imagine to my surprise when i look down today,
 i live in a manufactured home (fancy term for a doublewide) and we have a wooden deck on the house.<n> whoever built the deck didn't put adequate support beams in the middle of the deck, so it's bowing pretty badly.<n>well, because of the bowing, the grill fell and one of the charcoals fell out without me realizing it.<n>i move the grill to see a decently sized hole (probably two feet long and 10 inches wide) had been burned through the deck.
 my boyfriend and i are getting ready to lay down and he tells me to make the bed. (because i move around a lot in my sleep and mess up the bedding.) the lights are already off and i go to make the bed.<n>as i am moving the covers around, i notice what looks like a small box, a small ring box. my heart stops, and he says \what is that?\<n>...it's the charging port to his phone charger. ...it's the charging port to his phone charger.
 my current ones were ok, they were a bit noisy but i had no reason to change.<n>my \u00a313 upgrade turned into an \u00a380 new windscreen. yeah her \u00a313 upgrade turned into an \u00a380 new windscreen. the wipers suck too.
 I've gotten drunk once before, and had a beer or two maybe six other times .<n>My anus seems to be the only thing that realises what a bad idea this is .<n>Head office has noticed a disturbance. an off balance.<n>some huge negative feedback loop starts the process of removing this foreign substance from my digestive tract .
 last weekend, i came home because my parents live in the same town that i go to college.<n>well, i knew it was gonna be bad because i had started having stomach problems Saturday morning.<n>i started feeling sweaty and uncomfortable with slight bubbly feelings, and as these are the normal symptoms for me when i start getting sick, i just knew.<n>i estimate i have a fever of 100, but i haven't bothered to do anything but take some acetaminophen because i have to go through my little sister's baptism.
 i was sitting in my seat with my mom when i felt the urgent need to pee.<n>i get up and make my way to the bathroom and lock the door behind me.<n>Suddenly the whole bathroom shakes from the plane hitting some 'unexpected' turbulence which sent my urine everywhere.<n>i panicked and backed out of the stall and nearly bumped into the window and calmly and inconspicuously walk over to my seat, reeking in urine.<n>i take a look behind me to see an air hostess standing in my urine because when she opened the door due to some complaint by another passenger all my pee leaked out onto her brand
 i met a girl a while back, and we decided to keep in contact over facebook, because she lives a little way away from me .<n>We chatted for a while, and i didn't know she had a boyfriend, until she told me, but she said we could still be friends .<n>After a while, we decided to meet up (as friends, nothing else, i'm not that type of person)<n>i noticed it was incredibly uncomfortable, tense and frosty she told me after she felt bad, because she was with someone, and it didn't feel right, but nothing happened (or
 i had a popping sensation in my left shoulder, followed by immediate pain.<n>i had a [subluxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subluxation) in my shoulder joint.<n>this had happened to me a total of 3 times before, over the course of approximately the last 3 years.
 i'm with my friend who i'll refer to as phil. phil.<n>after a relatively brief stop of an hour and a half, the cops let my friend phil and i off.<n>i didn't bring my wallet with me today for odd reason prior to going to patrick's house; i have a copy of my license and registration in my glove box, so i don't worry about being pulled over without my license. anyway.<n>just because i'm lucky, it turns out the same exact cops that pulled me over before, captain hardass and his friend lieutenant
 i was 14 and was hanging out with a friend walking around the woods behind our neighborhood.<n>We came across a 4x4 raised sewer drain and decided that we could catapult stuff off it using the sweet board we found.<n>i jump on the board and send that sucker flying through the air.<n>well as you all know frogs jump and after i placed him on the board he hops off.<n>i tell my friend to \hold on\ and bend down to pick him up to put it back on.<n>10 stitches later and i realized that catapulting frogs is not the best idea.
 i haven't seen this guy since last semester and didn't give the employee taking orders my name .<n>he commented on \how on earth i could be single\ and such multiple times .<n>i turn red faced, bow still askew, looking like a flustered idiot and mumble something along the lines of \oh i must have left them in the car\
 i was in a bachelor party with a big group of friends (18 of us) in a cruise ship.<n>A long time ago, the groom went scuba diving and got sunburnt like a racoon, so we nicknamed him like that, the racoon (in english)<n>i noticed first, when i was drunk as hell and left the ship's night club and got approached by two enormous black dudes who asked me \what's with the t-shirt?\
 my neighbor across the street was around 80 years old and had lived in that house for as long as i could remember .<n>He fell down and died, pretty gruesomely. he broke his neck and his arm he used to brace his fall ended up being ripped to shreds .<n>One of my tombstones that got blown over to his house by the wind.<n>the tombstone that ended up on his lawn was that of humpty dumpty, with the phrase \i was pushed!\

She is completely selfish and is an alcoholic .<n>My husband and i live with her while we get back on our feet .<n>i bring lunch to work because while at work i am not allowed to leave the property .<n>i want to tell my mother in law (let's call her alice) that i don't want her eating the hot pockets without asking first, or at the very least replacing them .
 we decided to get a futon online, argos was offering a nice discount and a garanteed delivery time of two working days.<n>we decided to just walk into their store next door, knowing we'd lose our internet rebate, but hoping we'd still get a fast delivery: no go, we lost both, they offered a delivery two and a hal weeks later. not thrilled, but it was necessary so we took it.<n>a week later, i appear to have completely forgotten the dates, and lost the receipt for the couch, so i arrange for the soa-bed to be taken out,
 i would never wish what happened for the next 12 hours on any person .<n>violent throwing up, explosive diarrhea, and the worst headache of my life .
 I work in the it department of a large company whose business depends on a particular website being up .<n>After 2 hours, and no results, i needed help.<n>By 1:45 am, i doze off, spooning my computer. oh my god.<n>i finally get rescued by another it guru at work. but now i have to wait and see what trouble i'm in.
 Last week i got my paycheck from my job and then proceeded to deposit it using an electronic deposit app for my bank on my phone.<n>the deposit went through the next day but said it was on a 7 day hold.<n>i tried calling my bank, but they said they couldn't lift the hold.<n>i asked if i could just take the check and cash it elsewhere since the check technically hadn't deposited yet.<n>the customer service representative said yes but i'd be charged a fee once the hold was lifted.<n>seeing as one of my bills had already charged my account, throwing me into a negative
 i'm taking a culinary class in school, because i absolutely suck at cooking.<n>so we learned a lot of basics, stuff we already know, blah, blah blah... and all was good.<n>Then, the teacher assigned us to make our own version of the scones, with our own added twist.
 i got drunk before i went to bed last night, one of my favorite shows (american horror story) started its new season .<n>i went to the store and got some drinks and got shitty, then passed out .<n> woke up some unknown amount of time later and needed to go pee, so i just hop out of bed and right around the corner to the bathroom .
 i like to add a bit of humour to some of my posts and earlier today i'd written something about the most popular dishes in the UK .<n>i thought \i know what, i'll bung a meme into the post.\ not just any old meme, a fat person meme.<n>as i've got the search page open on google with fat people memes galore, the really fat guy in the office walked past my desk, scowled at me and carried on his merry way.
 i ripped off a medium sized one, about half a thumb and shoved it in my mouth biting bits off as i go .<n>then after about 5-10 seconds it got hot, and hotter until my lips and throat were burning so much i ran into the kitchen, and drunk a whole pint of milk .<n>my nose now stings like my lips did .
 he handed me a spray bottle of weed killer and said \just spray all the weeds\<n>after about an hour of going over about 80% of the lawn with weed killer, he walked out and asked what i was doing.<n> calmly explained to me that weed killer kills grass too. he mowed the lawn before hand too, so the fact that he did it all for nothing made him a teeny bit angrier.
 My family and i are hispanic. we live in a middle class all white neighborhood .<n>A man with the same car, and the exact same color, pulls up next to us, and leaves the door unlocked.<n>i told them to let my father hand me the car keys, i lead them to the car, go unlock it and tell them that this is the car that belongs to us. and that we were not, under any circumstances trying to steal a car.
 my wife's friend \jan\ came to stay with us for a week, essentially using our home as a staging area to visit all her old friends.<n>She is quite attractive (but not as hot as my wife) and frequently was gone for hours at a time.<n>well, i kept my shit together like an adult and didn't succumb to my desire.<n>when i was suspicious of why only one dog was watching me eat, i discovered him nosing through her pile of dirty (but folded) clothes.<n>by far the sweetest, best smelling pair i have ever had the pleasure of sampling.
 i am a gamer so naturally i have some servers running in my office .<n>i'm also a cheap person so my only way to monitor said servers is to use a old android phone i had laying around and use that as an ip camera .<n>my mom is pretty god damn religious and so is my sister. apparently when my sister got home she saw the phone, on a camera app, and absolutely flipped her shit .
 after breaking a sweat that had nothing to do with the heat, i tried walking, but that only made it worse .<n> finally i decided to suck it up and go to that old friend's house .<n>i was just getting a grip on the waistband of my shorts when i saw the huge hedge/bush by the side of the house .
 when i wen't over to my friends apartment to do a project, i went over to his kitchen thingy to mooch off some food.<n>i open some cabinets and find some gummies in a bag and start eating them after finishing the large bag of gummies i started to feel like my stomach was about to explode.
 reddit thought you could use a laugh at my stupidity for the last few days, there is a girl i really like and care for we shall call her nikki since she is a redditor also, but i shall take you from the start of my fucks up with nikki .<n>She asked me to describe my perfect girl so i described the complete opposite of her, so she holds that one against me for the rest of the time we have known each other .<n>The next fuck up was slight i told her to loose weight because i am an inconsiderate asshole, but she eventually forgave me
 my boss is a woman in her early 40's, and she was having router troubles at home. no problem, i can stop over on my way home, fix her router up in 10 minutes and earn some brownie points.<n> keep in mind, this is an expensive house in the rich part of town. typical rich bastards, but having them on your side comes in handy more often than not.
 within a few seconds, both my girlfriend and i, along with her bed, some of her clothes and a large portion of the floor were covered in vanilla coke.
 My dad grew up as a poor black kid in a shit part of the bronx ny, and self-emancipated himself at a very young age .<n>He received a surprise visit from his sister (i was about 8 at the time, she bought me a sega genesis - greatest aunt ever)<n>Now this sister is the unpredictable one, she loves to fuck with people .
 mohawk, a white bull terrier, loves to chase a tennis ball .<n>Half a second after he'd thrown the ball i started to connect the dots .<n>the driver slammed on his brakes immediately, and there simply was no way .<n>he did multiple barrel rolls before he was dragged out of view to the right, where the truck shuddered to a stop .
 when you try to pet him while hes relaxing outside he'll run way from you into bushes or something.<n>i tried to pet him and he ran into a little strip of trees that separate the (busy) road from our house.<n> dusty's leg was ripped off and he bled out behind the tree a few feet from our front door.
 My dog tends to chew things. usually things that i love, shoes, movies, exercise equipment.<n>So to combat this i put him in a kennel while i am at work.<n>It's not cruel, it's a very large kennel and he has tons of room, he can walk around stretch out ect.<n>So when it's starting to get bad, the poop is splooshing out over the sides of the cage and leaving a long, yellow trail all the way to the door.<n>The worst part of the whole thing is that once i finally get the cage picked up and over to the

 i've been seeing this girl every other week for 4-5 months. she gives an hour for 30 dollars and i tip her 20 every time.<n>i've never said anything sexually suggestive and have *never* dreamed of trying anything physical with her in the middle of a session.

 after pulling an all-nighter studying for exams, i decided to take my sleeping medicine (restoril) at 11 am.<n>after i slept for a little while, my body must have decided to wander around the fraternity house and accept whatever everyone was doing.<n>apparently while i was on the way to mcdonalds i was convinced my parents were with us and i had to make sure they got out of the car.<n>i finally got back to my room and my girlfriend came over. apparently she gave me head (which i don't remember) and then we had sex later on.
 when i got home no one else was home, which is unusual because at least one of my brothers are home or my parents will sometimes make it home before me .<n>since i was home alone i took advantage and played music loud, played video games and ate junk food .<n>i showered and did a little manscaping and then i had the brilliant idea of shaving my ass. don't ask why because i don't have a reason .

 over the course of 6 hours my stomach has painfully bloated and makes noises i've never heard before .<n>my roommates have the joy of seeing me stand up and go to the bathroom over and over again .<n>in the end i decided it would be best to just stay in the fetal position in the bathroom, ready to jump onto the toilet as soon as the bubbling force reached its peak .
 I got up to take a massive shit. went and found the bathroom and got down to business.<n>i clogged that bitch. frantically searching for a plunger and to no avail did i find one.<n>the next best thing i could find was an empty toilet paper roll.<n>good news? got the toilet unclogged without anyone knowing what happened. bad news? my hand to my forearm was coated in feces and urine.

 \i'm going to regret so much tonight if i don't do this...,\ and i'm going to kiss her, but her face was so close i just got so scared. keep in mind i'm an awkward fucking penguin and have never kissed anyone. then i bury my face in her chest as she said, \what, not kissing me?\ and i'm just like, \i'm scared\
 she asked me for my phone, so that she wouldn't get bored.<n>well, she made a drama about it after class. saying that she didn't want to be my girlfriend anymore.<n>i tried to talk her...when suddenly, i don't know why the fuck i did it, but i let out an \i love you\
 i discovered awhile back that i never sunburn, no matter what.<n>i also don't tan very easily either.<n>i would go with friends to outside festivals or concerts without sunscreen on, and by the end my friends would be all burnt and i'd be completely fine.
 i moved away after graduation and only come home for dire situations.<n>i'm 25 years' old and my parent's still frown upon swearing in front of them.<n>i'm in the house of the lord, in front of my parents, and i can feel every single eye on me.

 i decided to use the short-tunneled blow dryer instead of the long one with the safety attachment.<n>The back of this particular blow dryer has a metal mesh-like cap over an insane metal fan.<n>This fan goes ridiculously fast and it's really powerful. think: windtunnel.
 \i washed my hands, like, ten times! everything should be fine!\<n>i looked at my boyfriend and said, \i feel like gob\ and told him the whole sordid affair.<n>he googled and told me that milk would help extinguish the burning, so i grabbed the rest of the half gallon we had in the fridge, ran to the bathroom and poured ice cold milk on my angry vagina.<n>nothing could have felt worse. burning quickly turned into icy horror as my vag tried to close up and escape.
 i showed my sister how to drive a go kart .<n>She drove straight into her friend's dad's porsche .<n>i told my sister to apologize but she never did .<n>i've never felt so fucking stressed out and embarrassed in my entire life .
 my boyfriend was visiting for this past weekend but was not allowed to stay in my room despite me living away for the past five years and my parents being completely aware that i stay in his room at his apartment when i visit.<n>we were actually just laying in bed redditing but my dog was barking ferociously downstairs so i made the executive decision to close the door to my room so we could hear the tv in the background and continue relaxing while on the internet.<n>my mom comes upstairs and sees my bedroom door closed... immediately assumed we're having sex... immediate bitch session.
 i had the worst diarrhea of my life.<n>my boxers somehow got covered in diarrhea so i put those and the piece of paper in a plastic bag i found.<n>i ended up walking by part of the football team going to the locker room, some soccer players, the local high school cross country team, and finally make it back to my room.<n>when i get out of the shower, one look in the mirror reveals that, on top of all of this, i look high as hell.
 i asked my 25 year old-college graduate of a cousin if he could watch my kid for an hour until i got home. stupid me, i assumed that even a 12 year old could handle such a task.<n>i came home to my 4 year old climbing on the railing of our balcony and the sitter tells me \i think the dog hurt his leg\.<n>i look at the dog and my 5 month old puppy that we have only officially had for 4 damn days (we participate in rescue/foster dogs and only officially adopted him 3 days before) is writhing in pain.
 One of my friends asked if i wanted to hang out and get some ice cream .<n>It was the first time we were meeting in person; i had played dota with him, and we had mutual friends, but we had never spent any time in person together .<n>he comes to my house at around 19:45, and we head off to get ice cream at the dairy queen in my town .<n>it was next to an empty a&p, so i suggested we go to my park so we don't seem completely suspicious sitting in his car, eating ice cream .
 i woke up super tired, like usual.<n>One of them was wish this girl a happy birthday.<n>Now it's these two girls that i talk to that are twins.<n>i tried to explain to her (the girl that didn't respond) that i didn't realize that they had the same birthday.
 i had a rum and coke in me and decided to have a bath to explore myself and whatnot. so i run the bath and it's hot as hell but whatever, i tough it out and eventually i manage.<n>i won't go into fapping details because seriously wtf not important but after awhile i started feeling really hot, so i stood up in the tub.<n> suddenly dizziness hits me like a truck.<n>i've passed out before and i've had all the warning signs i was on the road to faintsville.
 My friends and I went to a crazy motorcycle festival in ybor City last night .<n>When the band finished up and left i decided to try my luck at the closest bar .<n>The bartender was pretty busy and didn't have the time to check id or anything so she ended up serving us through the night .<n>At this point during the night three more joined our group including tino, my good friend who i will call robert, and the girl he had been having relations with for the past few months, maya .<n>We hang out for a while and have an awesome time and i
 i was downloading something, and because the download needed 5+ hours to be completed, i decided that it would be a good idea to get some sleep.<n>i put the laptop near the edge of my bed (yes stupid move, i know) and go to sleep on the other side.<n>i am woken up by my grandmother's shouting and i immediately saw that i had kicked my mother's laptop off the edge, screen down.
 i was at my friends house even there since about 8pm and we just smoke out .<n>we end up drinking a bit and smoking even more .<n>at about 5am we all end up getting ready to fall asleep and i'm in the room with all the girls .<n>i'm laying down on the floor trying to fall asleep when my stomach starts to bubble .<n>i fart like i've never farted before, very strung out loud and smelly one at that .
 as a team, we stayed in a hotel not too far away from the course with some other schools that were racing.<n>at about 1:00 am, the anger starts to kick in.<n>i get so mad that i decide to put on my jacket and some shoes, and go out for a run to simmer down.<n>before anyone could stop me, i took off running straight down the road.<n>the only landmark i knew was that i was staying in a hilton hotel across the street from a wal-mart.
 krazy-glue burst out the end of the tube and was now dripping all over .<n>some had gotten on my finger, didn't get it glued to any other body parts but still was rough on the skin .<n>my fucking phone is superglued to the countertop of the place i'm renting .
 so i wanted to see if this stuff actually worked.<n>i applied it to my whole body, being a hairy human and all, but i think i kept it on past the required time.<n>the fucking hair did not come off, even after scrubbing with my towel. that shit burns.<n>unfortunately, some of it seeped into my crack, and it wasn't long before the itchy burning spread all over.<n>i then muscled through it, and decided to finish the rest by using this smooth and effective pink razor my mother keeps on the shelf.
 i've lived in Europe for the last three years and haven't been to one of my favorite stores ever since i moved.<n>well one week into being in the states i'm walking through target holding a basket by the holes on the side rather than the handle.<n>Eventually i get my pointer and ring finger out but my middle finger is still stuck.<n>my finger hurts and i love target so i'm going to have to face these people who know what a stupid man-child i am constantly.
 i'm standing at the stove, frying up some salmon for breakfast cuz why the hell not.<n>i go to flip it, when i suddenly feel something crunch under my foot causing me to jump ever so slightly, dropping the salmon.<n> splashed very hot olive oil on my hand, leaving a very painful burn.
 her practice schedule requires no external contact from anyone for a week.<n>i screencapped a picture of her stalkers facebook, and made a fake facebook post around coming to see her performance day next week, in an attempt to come to me to help her.<n>after i did that, i sent her the .psd file with all the layers not flattened, and the truth came out that i tried to manipulate her.
 we decided to sneak upstairs and get it in, no sex though because we had heard a rustle downstairs .<n>this terrified both of us so we go back downstairs, my cousin is in a position to see us so i try to pass it off as us trying to play with my dog .<n>my tv, which was previously on when we snuck up, was turned off. odd.<n>my sisters, both older than me by about 12 years are with my parents.<n>i get a text from one of them that says this: \be careful with what you do with your girlfriend, tell her i said hi\
 he owes over $500 to sprint, so they refuse to take him off the phone without him paying his bill .<n>i planned to email him, threatening to call china and leave the call going overnight, but now sprint won't allow calls until the bill is paid .
 i was selling 2 different things. one was arranged at an office max. the other at my house.<n>the person arranged at office max didn't contact me for days and i thought he didn't want the thing anymore.<n>the other person was new and asked for my phone number yesterday. today morning, i got a text asking to meet up, specifically with the thing he's buying in the text. i somehow skipped that part and thought it was the guy arranged at my house, but it was the office max guy.
 i started my second year at college (english, not american)<n> sitting in a room with another course, my friend and i were looking at the malicious advice mallard meme, so said girl and i start chatting, before our groups are split back up.<n>after an hour of drawing and such, i find the girl and we start talking again (still didn't know her name at this point)<n>about 5 minutes later my friend, let's call him john, sits down with us and notices that we are similar, personality wise, so using his phone, tells me to ask her out.<n>please bear
 after school, some big ass dude came up to me and started confronting me.<n>He was like \if you don't stop talking like that to my daughter, i'm going to report you to the police and the school.\<n>i've never gotten in major trouble in school so of course i freaked the fuck out.
 i don't know what the fuck happened, but both me and my boyfriend just completely froze in position.<n>i can't even describe the look that was on his face, though i'm sure it mirrored my own.<n>i plan to stay at my boyfriend's place until he's absolutely sick of me to the point of it potentially ruining our relationship.
 It was a hot summer day back in high school. licked hormones were raging, and me and my boyfriend were looking for a place to get sexy.<n>We finally found a place down what we thought was not a well traveled trail. just to be safe we wandered about 10 yards off the trail, then things started getting hot and sweaty.<n>i start getting by not one, but two dogs.<n>i hear an old women shriek, and realize \oh cool, this trail is more well traveled than we thought\ as i make eye contact with an elderly man and woman innocently out waling their dogs.
 my kid was running around with a knife, while i was cooking. apparently he was 'playfighting' his words not mine. he ran with the knife straight into my leg and embedded half of it in.<n>then because i\m retarded, and for some reason my brain tells me the logical thing to do is chisel it out with another knife.
 i'm just gonna say that if i remember a past fuckup i'm gonna post it on thursday and hashtag that bitch tbt!<n>i really won't care if you don't participate, i just love pulling together for fun times.
 i began to wake up with a slight but sharp pain coming from toes, moving from toe to toe like some little pin pricks .<n>after a few seconds of this i was wide awake and instinctively wanted to find out what the hell this was .<n>i ripped a muscle in my neck and immediately fell back down in excruciating pain.<n>after a good 20 minutes of trying i manned up, gritted my teeth and threw my self out of bed and immediately fell to my knees in pain.<n>after 3 hours of ridiculous pain and tedium i was seen by a doctor and was given some codeine,
 i adopted a cat from the shelter who had previously had ear mites. they were cleared up with revolution .<n>the vet said to clean out we ears and the gross bits inside with q tips to make sure they weren't coming back.<n>so here i am in my bathroom trying to clean out my cat's ears (which is hard enough) then she does the violent-cat-head-shake.
 my current bf is the first guy i've had any sexual experience with, he however is not new to the act so i tend to feel obligated to go all out .<n>my moment of feeling so sexy turned to a walk of shame down the hall to make sure the poor fellow was okay .
 Crayons slip out of busboy's apron and melt all over his clothes .<n>Craters melted all over everyone's clothes .
 i gmail'd myself my lesson plan, and intended to print it at school in the morning when i got there.<n>i ask my associate teacher to enter her login information so i could access the internet on the classroom computer. she does, and remains hovering over me.<n>i had multiple replies from emails i had used to send naked pictures to my fwb (friend with benefits).<n>the first few inbox replies had subject lines such as: \my wet, naked body just for you\, \what you'll cum home to\, and \just a little something to get you through your long shift ;)
 i procrastinated cleaning until this morning at 7am an hour before my landlord said he was going to show up .<n>i hadn't slept yet and i was literally running on zero sleep. so i figured i'd make a pot of coffee, stay up until the landlord came by, and then pass out as soon as he left .
 i left my car unlocked (despite out of habit always pressing that lock button on my key fob)<n>i'm baffled that it only took one rainy day for my 160gb ipod (completely full), gps, charging cables and mount to all get taken out of my car in my drive way.
 i went to a school that had a real deal soccer team, who happened to be playing our rival school in the state finals one fine friday evening.<n>because i think i'm cool hanging out with some of my upperclassmen friends i decide to join them in drinking copious amounts of cuervo.<n>well fast forward to after i've been screaming obscenities at the players on the field for about 20 minutes (so so subtle), i decide its high time to make a run to the bathroom.<n>without thinking to have a friend join me in navigating the sea of people between the concession stand and myself
 when ever i use them, i have to scrape the seeds out...unless i want nuclear food.<n>i once chopped one up, didn't wash my hands properly, and later that evening i rubbed my eye. it straight up felt like my eye was melting.
 as i was mowing the grass at my house (note: i live on a lake with a large hill leading into it) i began like any other time by putting in my ipod.<n> suddenly my legs began to feel wet.<n>i looked down(mower still running) and realized i had annihilated a big bullfrog.
 I was in Spanish class and the girl who sits next to me is a very open lesbian (not that i have any problem with that we're actually pretty friendly)<n>As i'm just sitting there listening to her, and in a blaze of absent minded ignorance i blurt out \gosh, that is soooo gay\ needless to say she went berserk and made me feel like the most bigoted ignorant jackass (which i probably am)
 i really needed a piss, so as soon as the guy had been paid i went upstairs to the bathroom to relieve myself.<n>the blinds were open (you can see where this is going), but i thought; \meh, he'll start downstairs at the front\<n>30 seconds later, and i saw nothing other than the window cleaner's ladder appear outside, and heard footsteps on the rungs.<n>the floodgates were open; there was no way i was holding back this piss.
 long day of teaching was finally out of the way and i decided to hop in the shower before correcting.<n>i grab the razor in a haphazard motion from the ledge and quickly bring my arm back across my body.<n>then i shaved some and then i looked down and my worst idea had happened: i nicked my nipple with the razor.<n>i literally shaved off the skin from one side of my nipple by being a little overzealous with a razor in my worn-out state.
 i emailed my teacher and asked if, just to be silly, i could bring in a gas mask to wear instead of safety glasses. she emails me back and gives me the ok as long as i don't wear it outside of the classroom.<n>At 10:30 i get called out of class to go to the on campus police officer's office, more commonly referred to as op. apparently they found the canister in the cafeteria and thought it was part of a bomb.<n>once i arrive at op's office after being escorted by two other cops i had never seen before i get put in a chair and they search my
 i recently got a laptop and have been using it for about a week or so. now i have been having the same occurring problem where my internet connection would go from private to public on its own causing my internet to disconnect.<n> after much frustration and days of google searching and trying to fix it i decided to just call tech support. after a few minutes of talking the it guy said that the best thing to do was to reset my computer to factory setting.
 i left some eggs to boil and forgot about them for 2 hours because i was playing gta san andreas.<n>i started to smell something burning but for some reason didn't get up.<n>two hours had passed and i finally figured it was something inside my house.<n>the entire house is full of smoke. visibility is about 90%.<n>Thankfully it's just the eggs, and i was able to open up all the doors and windows as well as turn on all the fans while simultaneously running through the house fanning smoke out with a big dry-erase board.
 yesterday i had sun poisoning. pain, nausea, joint pain, blurred vision. all the normal things that happen when i spend a day in the sun.<n>this morning i decided to exfoliate-toner-moisturize.<n>now i can't see my back. my mirror is off the wall while my vanity is being replaced.<n>my skin is ruined. it's going to look like i was victim of a flaying for the rest of my life.
 i had a cold yesterday but could tell it was coming along .<n>got up and ready for airsoft at my local centre. all is good feeling great and refreshed but could tell a cold was coming along .<n>Went to the car for some shade and a break. had another two bottles of water. put the ac on in the car. still to warm, sat in just my tee shirt. not good enough.<n>Thought it could be due to hunger, ate 2 hot dogs. not hunger, starting to feel sick.<n>Went back to the car slept in the shade, felt ok driving home and i was
 i'm watching episode 17 of black butler. [the episode, if you're interested](http://www.dubbedonline.com/black-butler-episode-17-english-dub) i reach a fun part... and my dad walks in to show me a guitar i might like.<n>Knowing him, there's no doubt he told the rest of my family just to be an asshole.
 i had already clocked for the day and was bagging an order before i left.<n>i noticed the ticket said \??\ in the note line, and i thought \reminds me of the riddler.. i should write a riddle!\<n>the answer of course being \nothing\ here's the part that in hindsight i could've done better with (besides that riddle in the first place)<n>well, the customer got her order, and her children promptly freaked out, which freaked her out. she took pictures of the boxes, sent those to corporate, and the following day at work my manager sat me
 i tripped and fell face first, onto a large nest of red ants. didn't have time to wipe them of my face since i knew the bees would cause a lot more damage if they caught up.<n>i managed to get in but two bees caught up and stung me on the side of the neck and my ear.<n>i don't know what hurt more, the numerous ants that i was trying to wipe of my face, or the sting on my neck and ear.
 i applied a fuckload of nair all over my junk, my balls and pubes were completely coated in the stuff .<n>what happened next was possibly the most excruciating pain i think i've ever felt in my life .<n>i laid in the shower on my back with my legs above my head, so my asshole and dick could get all the water .
 i have no fucking clue about computers other than basics .<n>i was aware it's a memory problem and the most logical step was to wait until tommorow and ask for a replacement (warranty)<n>i then carefully placed the computer's sides upwards so i could get a good look .
 i had been trying to find a first job as a teenager for a month before i got hired as a host. anyways, i arrive at the restaurant a few minutes early for training.<n>after i cleaned a table, i went to get napkins and utensils to set onto the table.<n>the tray slipped out of my hands; forks, knives and spoons just poured like rain onto the floor.<n>my face flushing red, there was nothing i could do but pick up all the utensils on the floor, which amounted to about 3/4 ths of the supply, and send them to the back for the dishwasher to clean them.
 during the test, i was making a 3-point turn but hit the curb with the hubcap .<n>the examiner told me i didn't fail the test because of that but, i pretty much bombed the test, and afterwards when i told my instructor that i failed, he drove me home and that was it .<n>i realized afterwards that i forgot to tell him what i did when i looked at my phone later in the day and he left me a voicemail telling me to call him back .<n>i'm pretty scared to call him back because i think he's gonna accuse me of purposefully not telling
 when i registered online a few months back for the fall semester, i was almost sure that i had pressed the button that said \main campus only\ when searching through the available courses .<n>i did not do this and only found out about a week ago .<n>of my five classes, 3 of them are at the rio rancho campus which is 20 miles away and one is at the los lunas/valencia campus which is 30 miles away .
 i've been on a bit of a day drunk and he's tired and i'm bored.<n>we've been on a bit of a day drunk and he's tired and i'm bored.<n>we head back and we go to sleep for a bit after a lot of yelling. we sleep a little late as we're hungover and he sends me down to ask the doorman to call us a cab.<n>the airport is an hour away. the so manages to get us a cab called after we wait awhile but by the time we get to the airport it's 15 minutes before
 This is not the end of the fuck ups. but the fates jest, and this one is much more terrifying, but only slighlty less disgusting.<n> today i was still recovering for the doritos locos diarrhea shit storm my dog violently ejaculated from his asshole onto my face while sleeping. me and teddy have a rocky relationship at best at the moment.<n>i get in my bed and out of the corner of my eye, i see a mother fucking moth the size of a fucking gi joe. my face looked like the aftermath of a bug versus lamborghini head
 i was stuck with one of the worst sore throats i've had in a long while .<n>over the course of 3 days i only ate 3 cans of chicken noodle soup that were about 70 calories a piece .<n>i spent 3 horrendous days not trusting any fart as far as i could throw it and rushing to the restroom every couple of minutes .
 i went to the fast food eatery that happily serves 42 million people globally every day .<n>i got 2 hot & spicy sandwiches because fuck, they're a dollar a piece .<n>i made a bee line to the bathroom where the most fiery, painful liquid-esque shit i've ever produced in my entire life poured from my nether regions .
 after taking flagyl for three days and the bv itching is gone, i google what a yeast infection looks like .<n>i then proceed to spread my pussy lips and look down.<n>i see something resembling a white film, but nothing google-worthy.<n>i show it to him and ask him if he'd be down to have sex tonight and if he thinks i should talk to a doctor.<n>i show it to him and ask him if he'd be down to have sex tonight and if he thinks i should talk to a doctor.
 i was in china with some other students from the us, and we would get some alcohol every night while we were there .<n>the entire trip there was a girl from Ohio who had been hitting on me, but i didn't know how to make a move .<n> eventually, my friend slips, face plants on the tile roof at 2 in the morning, and stands up to reveal the nastiest goose egg i have ever seen .<n> since i was drunk, i panicked, carried him inside, gave him to my more sober friend, then proceeded to sprint around the building in terror until i realized my more
 i just wanted a sandwich, so i didn't bother with a cart going in .<n>because i didn't get a cart, i put them in my bag with my toys .<n>not only is my sub not meeting me, i'm now known as 'the creep that carries sex toys everywhere' at my favorite grocery store .
 i was cleaning up my boyfriend's art supplies that were just sitting in the corner of the living room next to the couch.<n>i decided to pack them all up in one of those giant plastic storage containers so that everything wasn't just lying around anymore.
 i was given some eyedrops to take if it happens again.<n>i have two more appointments for this on the 19th of April and on the 1st of may. actual tl;dr: had optic neuritis, but it was not linked to ms.
 i was told that i would be home alone and i should take care of the house.<n> knowing that i would be free of the familial prying eye for a good four hours, i decided the most relaxing thing i could possibly do was use the nicest shower in the house .<n>i decided after about 10 minutes of deciding between the food network channel and that home and gardening channel, that i would read a book.<n>while most of the books were downstairs, i decided to find a good read somewhere upstairs as i found the lower half of the house to be a wee bit far for someone who's in a state of
 i realize these are my friends panties, a girl we opened our home up to while she was visiting from California.<n>instantly he tells me it isn't what it looks like...i ask for an explanation...at this point he hasn't really told me what he does but all i know is he's \had a thing for women's panties for a year and a half now\<n>i'm not fucking sure how i am suppose to feel right now other than now i know why none of my panties fit, they are all stretched (which pisses me off even more because
 Tonight was my turn to stay with my mom in the hospital .<n>Since there are no beds available for guests at the moment, i fashioned one out of a bunch of chairs and a sleeping bag .<n>well, i took one of the many pillows that was piled on a chair, repositioned myself and rubbed my face into the deliciously comfortable hospital pillow .<n>i got a huge whiff of urine and mom pubes and i realized it was one of the pillows that the nurses placed between her legs so her knees don't rub up against each other .
 i saw some bucket thing that spins around on an angle, so it goes up and because of the angle it speeds up when going back down.<n>had a go on it and when i finally figured out how to stop it i got off dizier that a heavily intoxicated person. started walking in extremely tight circles unable to stop myself and tripped over a log and heavily bruised my leg.
 i'm in the navy working out of an aircraft hangar and today we had the mas (military police) come through our command with a drug dog.<n>well the dog comes up to my desk and he's starting to sniff pretty good, he starts smelling my pocket when all hell breaks loose in this dog's world.<n>he's barking, freaking out, practically shits himself. the ma freaks out also and grabs me and tells me to empty my pockets. so i pull out the 3 bucks i had.<n>he calls superiors and cuffs me. all this in front of coworkers and my chief.
 The last day i worked as a lifeguard at my local pool we decided it would be fun to ride my little bmx bike into the pool, basically just for shits and gigs.<n> anyway, after we're done, i'm soaking wet, and we have the bike out of the pool, it's almost closing time and as i'm walking the bike out of the pool area i set it down to fix my bathing suit.<n>as i pick it up, it falls off balance and becomes a teeter-totter of nastiness and the tire tears my already soft toenail straight up.
 i had a cold that day and i had been keeping a giant fucking lugie in my mouth because i had nowhere to get rid of it. it was too warm and gross to swallow and i couldn't just spit it on the floor. so anyway, she makes me laugh and this wad of my spit and mucous comes flying out of my mouth at mach 10 and lands on her shoulder.<n>i needed to fix the situation fast because she was making a scene. quickly, without thinking, i frantically grabbed for my nasal mouth juice.<n>i'm grabbing and snatching, trying to get it off this girl's
 by clenching your butt muscles like you are pushing out a bar of fudge during orgasm you will prevent ejaculation momentarily and induce a firehouse of cum .<n>my gf recently moved about 250 miles away to complete grad school at a prestigious university for her program.<n>this weekend was her birthday and she was suffering from a bad cold and sore throat so i decided to visit her to cheer her up.<n>i drove all 500 miles total there and back with pretty scenery looking at lots of horses/cows, and we spent some wonderful times bonding with me taking care of her like a knight in shining
 i was at the gas station late one night, about to buy $20 in gas and a snickers.<n>i got talking to the guy at the register, because work was slow that night, and he was cuuuuuuute. he failed to get the register open and went in the back to ask his manager.<n>i saw this as a great opportunity to let a fart i'd been holding back.<n>i tried to apologize, but he was hearing none of it. he don't need no cracker-ass ho lettin' poots up in his grill.
 my stomach seemed to be complying the entire time we were at the restaurant and on our way .<n>out of nowhere, i ran to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea .<n>i managed to get the toilet seat up and get my pants down before i exploded into the toilet, but it made a huge mess .<n>i jerked up, turn to kneel over the toilet, and let loose a geyser .
 when i knocked her down, i also dropped several of my own bags .<n>Turns out that i accidentally took one of her shopping bags with a few garments in it .
 i live across the street from a bar where i have become quite the regular along with some old timers from the subsidized housing building next door.<n>often, they get shitfaced and end up needing a helping hand across the street, a task that i have somehow inherited, though i don't mind it.<n>one day in particular, the delaney boys are taking quite a bit of booze to the face as is customary when social security checks arrive.<n>most of the crew disperses aside from one new face, who was having a hard time forming words, thoughts and equilibrium.
 i live in Canada, where french is the language of 80% of the population .<n>The running joke in the province is either that they don't speak french, or when they do, they do it hilariously badly .<n>So, determined to prove them wrong, and having studied french to university level, i have embarked on a campaign to try and get into as many french conversations as possible .
 i shouted at someone completely different, a friend-of-a-friend who in retrospect doesn't look anything like \j\<n> apparently they were quite confused, and next time i see them will be extremely embarrassing.
 on this dreary and lonely night, i decided to look up 'porn' on 'youtube' (yeah, porn on youtube... good job)<n>i eventually found something graphic, and decided to watch it, but i pressed tvqueue and it played on my dads 52 inch plasma with surround sound. he is still giving me the look to this minute...
 my mom kicked my dad out this summer (i'm 17) for reasons that don't pertain to the story.<n>he's physically disabled (broke both ankles) and very depressed.<n>well, the economy's in the shitter (or he has a shitty friend) so he got laid off yesterday because they didn't need him.
 after a great night of entertainment and conversation, we go back to her place .<n>She grabs me and starts grinding me on her bed .<n>after very feeble attempts to get her to stop, i just go along with it for a while .<n>She asks me for sex, i refuse because i have to condoms .<n>She almost begs me the third time and i seriously considered it, then reminded myself that i'm a shitty fucking person for even letting it get this far along, and refuse a final time .
 i had to pee really bad, like really bad, so i had the bright idea to use all my powers of multitasking and pee in an empty snapple bottle while still driving .<n>get myself set up and do the deed, fill up the bottle with about a millimeter to spare, cap it off and keep driving. now i'm moving along, feeling proud of my urination/driving prowess when i look down at the bottle sitting in my passenger seat and notice that the shitty seal on the cap is letting piss dribble out and soak into the chair..... god damn it!<n>the second the bottle leaves my hand though
 i've only tried weed once before, and i didn't feel it at all, so i haven't had it since.<n>well, i didn't feel it immediately like he did, it took me about 20 minutes to start feeling it .<n>well, it got to a point where i broke up with her over text, but i did make it obvious that i would welcome her back if the issue with caring and affection was fixed .
 because i've been so caught up this week in trying to clean my mess, i didn't even get a chance to get my folks a proper anniversary gift.<n>not to mention, it's mother's day today and i still didn't get a chance to get my mom anything because i've been locked in my room trying to get myself together.
 My milk empties most of its contents into my ketchup and my tray with some milk landing on the table .<n>One of my friends sitting across the table from me informs me that he can smell my mixture of milk and ketchup and sadness .
 I hate when my sister has friends over. she's in those pre-teen years where she has to look invincible in front of her friends.<n> today she had a friend over, and god did they (mainly she) piss me off.<n>first up, i'm sitting in my room, watching random youtube videos on my laptop.<n>i get up to go to the bathroom, and leave my laptop open on my bed, next to my cat (my cat loves me/my bed. not sure which.) so as i finish up in the bathroom, i enter my room just in time to see my
 i was taking a shower before we hit the road when i heard the clunk of the front door of our hotel room .<n>i guess paul must have forgotten his key card so i shut the shower off, tied a towel around my waist and walked out the front door to let my pal in like any true friend .<n>While i was getting another card paul comes walking in the door, and as soon as he realizes he's looking at me the laughing sets in .
 i'm on the phone with my roommate asking her how to turn off the oven when the next door neighbor guy, an awkward it guy about 10 years older than me, comes over.<n>i see him out the window, literally running toward my front door.<n>i run back to my room, giving him a what i realized later was a full back view from the front window, of course, and throw on some shorts.<n>after opening the door, we open all the windows to get the smoke out. my vibrator was sitting in plain sight, right on the living room couch, the entire time.
 i suddenly blacked out sometime between 11 and midnight (i think)<n>i woke up around 6, having no idea what was going on and yet still drunk enough to not be offput by that.<n>i went back downstairs to the party, which by then only had the hostess and one other guy left. when i got down there, i either realized or was told by them that it wasn't sweat...it was urine.<n>it took me ages to figure out why - it didn't seem wet or pissy at the time - and it wasn't until i went back to bed and woke up again i
 My throat was cut by large pieces of collosal chicken .<n>The sensation of eating is far too painful so i basically have had tiny bites of miscellaneous types of food .<n>i also couldn't go to a baseball game my gf got me tickets for because i was profusely sweating and was in no physical condition to attend .
 i had the heat on med-low and went in to make some fries and left the chicken for 5 minutes. went back out and the chicken was on fire, and the heat settings wouldn't go down.<n>The siding behind the bbq is all melted and about 5 panels need to get replaced.
 i broke my arm while arm-wrestling one year ago today .<n>my wrist and fingers were paralyzed for 7 months and only in the last few months have i been making progress .<n>i still have a pretty bad-ass scar and a few insensitive spots on my arm to make me remember my fuck up .
 this is not hyperbole. i have broken arms, cut penises, lost love.<n>i used my back up safety scissors to cut through some rather expensive bondage equipment and spent an hour dangling my red and angry self in a sink of cold water. anything approaching normal body temperature brought the pain back, fresh and new, like a bounding young puppy to play.<n> stick to the oral tabasco route, kiddies.
 sometimes the sharp corners of a post-it, or envelope, can push out stuff between your teeth, ya know?<n>well today i got one good and stuck right between my front teeth. in my attempt to pull it out the (hot pink) post-it ripped, wedging its remains further into my gums.
 by this point it's twenty past nine in the morning and i have an hour and 40 minuets to kill, so i decide to go to somewhere familiar and end up doing that for awhile .<n>when my friends go on their break i join them, i've completely lost track of time by this point and by the time i've noticed this, it's already half past 11 .<n>i go to the room that's been timetabled, or atleast i thought was timetabled, and no-one was in there, so i've ended up in the library fucking around on
 i received a text from a longtime friend asking if i'd be interested in a blow job .<n> thinking one of her friends took her phone and is simply messing with me, i answer coyly.<n>i feign concern, ask if her bf isn't doing it for her anymore, etc (remember, i'm thinking that this is one of her friends)<n>i found out that it actually is her and that her bf not only dumped her, but cheated on her. apparently, i was her goto revenge fun.
 i realized i had been a major slob and decided to go running.<n>i got ready started to head outside and realized my cat had missed his litter box and left a turd in the middle of the living room.
 last night i went out and got rather fucking pissed so i know it's stupid to trust farts on the day of the beeriod.<n>i've been trusting them all day long, being very cautious which lead me to being cocky and just letting them poison the air around me with the vile smell of shit and last nights stupidness.
 One of my family members got a state senator to attend an award ceremony .<n>My uncle asked if i would introduce the senator .<n>i kept it to about 3 minutes, because - as someone who hates public speaking - i always have the vague feeling that i'm wasting everyone's time .
 i was playing league with my headphones on and couldn't really hear much.<n>heard someone moving around, but i thought it was my roommate so i didn't really give it any thought.<n>Suddenly, i hear the door close and lock. now, my roommate only locks the door before we go to sleep and usually tells me beforehand, so thought it was strange.<n>half-naked muscular indian guy standing right there, saying nothing.<n>He ended up muttering some jibberish, stumbling around our room, and then proceeded to go to sleep in my roommate's bed.
 i'm an intern, so, usually i get out of work on time, and want to get home as quick as possible.<n>the only way out of london from where i work by tube is the jubilee line. following on from that i get a met line home, usually takes about an hour.<n>on this particular evening, i left work on time, only to find that both tube lines were part suspended due to some earlier signal failure and a trespasser on the track.<n>the crowds at the station were horrendous, and the barriers were shut off so no one was actually moving anywhere.<n>for some absurd reason,
 my dad and i were watching game 7 of the finals together. we've been catching all the games as, we both like it, and it makes for some good father-son time .<n>after an exciting first half, during the start of analysis, my dad asked, \hey, can i hear some of that kanye west?\<n>i really liked the symphonic and grandiose parts in his last record, and \yeezus,\ his album that came out this last Tuesday, had subverted his previous record so much i was on a \literary-critique high\
 i notice my unibrow is growing back so i shave it with a razor, no big deal.<n>day 2 the area is a little sore, i ignore it, i get pimples sometimes. day 3 i see a pimple and try with all my might to bust it wide open. nothing happens and it kinda has that pulsing pain feeling.<n>day 4 i wake up and my fucking eye is swollen shut and the whole side of my face has gained a pound.<n>i feel like i rubbed the side of my head against a cheese grater and then dumped my head in alcohol. the pain sucks and i'

 i was rushing off to the gym and remembered i hadn't taken my vitamins and supps yet for the day. so i grabbed my magic pills, which include 2 fish oil capsules, and went to down 'em on my way out the door.<n>i quickly realized i had already put my water bottle in the car and was in too much of a hurry to get a new drink to swallow my pills with.<n>Put the pills in your sports bra, yoga pants have no pockets and the bra will keep 'em contained for a minute or two.
 my friend, who is a big marine dude, gets arrested for drunkenly threatening a girl with a knife.<n>after he was subdued by the cops, i decide to go drink more down the street.<n>i was drinking a beer while i was walking (which is illegal in maryland) and drunkenly stumbled upon a cop giving a girl a citation.

 i thought my room mate was going to be gone for the rest of the afternoon, so i decided to get a little freaky with myself.<n>then i though, \fuck it, i'll take off my pants and underwear, and get really into it\<n>just as i'm getting to the best part, i hear the door start to unlock.<n>i'm pretty sure my heart actually exploded from the initial terror and my brain shut down, so i had just enough time to pull my laptop over my dick, and just sit there like a moron.
 my dad made a bbq with a side of meatballs which were cooked in a pot on the wok which extends from the barbeque .<n>i stuck my finger in the pot and got a nice blob of grease on it, then stuck it in my mouth.<n>i picked one up (assuming it was a bit of meat left over from the night's dinner) and stick it in my mouth.<n>i then proceed to do what most people do when they put something in their mouth, and my masticating reflex kicks in.<n>i then proceed to do what most people do when they put something in their mouth, and my
 i see a dude dressed in all black with a backpack going from car to car. it looked like he was trying to get into them.<n>i call 911 and tell them about this dude. so i call 911 and tell them about this dude.<n>Finally, 7 cop cars pull up and 2 of them get out of the car and run up to him. right as one of the cops (on foot) acknowledge that i'm the one who called 911 (as he's walking up to me), my friend who was walking around the parking lot comes up to me and tells me the guy was just putting flyers on
 we are in a buick enclave so it's got /some/ stretch space.<n>i take a solid two and a half hour snooze and wake up at the next stop.<n>i woke up to the most unbearable back pain that prevented me from getting out of the car and stretching.
 i thought i would have a quick 1 minute breakfast of a muffin and what i thought was cranberry juice.<n>in my haste i did not read the label of the juice bottle in the fridge and just threw it right down the hatch.<n>with the head cold, i did not notice any major taste difference.<n>i was feeling a bit queasy as i have never drank prune juice before.<n>i thought perhaps my breakfast of four coffees and a muffin made my stomach feel upset so i did not think much about it.<n>However i decided to let out a little steam during locker break...it..was..not.
 i've been going out every night to network, seek out amazing beers, and just enjoy the art of conversation with friends .<n>last night, boyfriend and i are on our way to a \bourbon, beer, bacon and beards\ party at a bar.<n>thanks to a few shots of makers mark and a few quickly downed glasses of sonoma county stout on an empty stomach...never made it to food.<n>blacked out at the bar; came to with my head hanging in a bucket and my boyfriend letting paramedics into our apartment to try and take me to the hospital.<n> woke up hours later
 one player got the ball and was running towards the goal,head first not even looking where he was going, and kicked the ball full force towards the goal .<n>like full on dolphin dove to block the ball, and she did.<n>without thinking i yelled \ nice thunder-thighs block c!\ she smiled because she knew i hadn't meant to be mean, and went to smack my head in a playful manor .

 when i got to the parking lot...my car wasn't there... i began to freak out.<n>\who the fuck would steal my car?\ to the police station...the police tell me they need my plate number to file the report and, since i am registered out of state, they didn't have the authority to look up my number.<n>10 minutes pass, i'm almost home and i receive a call. \we found your car.\ so soon? with no number? it's a miracle!

 In the past couple of days my blood-glucose had been running high .<n>I bump my lantus dose up to 42 units and the next day i'm still high and forgetting the rule i say fuck it and push it all the way up to 46 units.<n>The next day both adjustments kick in at the same time and basically it started at 4 am a continous stream of low blood glucose levels i'm constantly shaking and can't move for about six hours and passing out multiple times and very nearly entered a comatose state.
 i was at my class before the bell rang and i was sitting there alone when i saw my friend, who is black.<n>so i was quoting this one really funny video (i'm too lazy to post the link but if people are curious i'll link it in the comments) when i leaned over and said to him 'go back to Africa!' when the i turn around and see the professor standing right behind me.

 when i was done, i grabbed a wash cloth that was nearby and wiped up the water then threw the towel on top of my laundry pile.<n>i saw in the mirror that i had some extra face wash on my face, so i *accidentally grabbed the shit rag* from the top of the laundry pile and put it on my face.
 Last week i sent out two gift packages. one to a football player in the bay area (sf) and one to singer in la. the football player is a size xxl and the singer is a size small.<n> somehow, when i was labeling the bags i swapped the labels and ended up shipping the giant football player a size small and the tiny pop singer a size xxl.
 i was 10 when this happened. one night i was sitting on a couch with my sister and her son, my nephew (2 years old)<n> once my sister got off the couch, my nephew got comfortable by laying on his back on the couch. few seconds later, he was trying to get back up so he can sit properly to drink his milk.<n>our living room floor was polished wood so right when he hit the floor, he made a huge bang sound then he bursts into tears.
 i went for a jump with 2 girls about 2 weeks ago .<n>Went through 3 huge knots on the way down .<n>The last, huge, about the size of 2 softballs goes through my ass .<n>My asshole still burns, and i'm sitting here writing this while i'm in the toilet afraid to take the 20 chicken nugget and large fry shit that came from the mcdonald's i ate before going .
 My boyfriend and i have been going strong on a diet for a few months now.<n>He went out with his buddies last night and left me home alone.<n>it was a perfect chance for a super secret cheat day, but nothing in the house was worthy of the occasion.<n>i decided to go to mcdonald's and order the most ridiculous thing possible: a mcrib sandwich.
 i neglected to check the toilet at work today which i normally do. (yeah, that's where this is heading.)<n>As i'm tucking my work shirt into my pants i feel a wet spot on the back of it.<n>i turned around to find someone's cum and piss on the back of the toilet at the base of the flush mechanism which would have been just beneath my asscrack.
 i let my cat in to come sleep with me. for the first hour, everything is fine and great, she's sleeping fine and i'm about to go to sleep, when she suddenly gets up and starts dry retching.<n> chunky bits of wet-food vomit all over my floor and bed-sheet.
 I decided to make myself a cup of tea to fight off the mid-evening snooze and get focused for the night ahead .<n>Instead of being a non-dumbass and just not making any tea, i decided it would be a better idea to search for an alternative drinking vessel to employ for the job .<n>The only remotely cup-worthy receptacle to be found was an apple sauce jar of dubious age .
 One of those 'wake up still kinda drunk and totally nauseous, you could throw up at any minute' type deals.<n>i work in a chem lab. they constantly need to be monitored and upkept with different intervals that are on a set schedule.<n>i had to meet with my supervisor and boss recently about my attendance. so calling out because of a hangover? yeah, no. suck it up, pussy.
 i honestly felt like i was invincible since it was friday...<n>i hit my finger dead-on, full force.<n>i spent an hour, driving uncomfortably home, followed by a clean-up and shower.
 my boss was always on edge with me. if i wasn't absolutely perfect he would threaten to fire me.<n> finally at the beginning of august late on sunday night i got a text saying that i would come in on Monday, my day off, without pay to \finish what i started\<n>i spent the whole night talking (and crying and hyperventilating) over the phone to my friend who said that he couldn't ask that of me and it was illegal. she said i had to tell him no. so i texted him back at 11:00 pm to say that i was sorry, but i couldn'
 after sitting with clients all morning, my back was really hurting, and i needed somewhere to stretch it out.<n>i first tried to do it standing up in the bathroom, but those stretches didn't reach the right muscles, so i knew i needed to lie down to do it.<n>i decided to do it underneath this big conference table because no matter where you walk, you can't see underneath it, unless you're bending down.
 my school turned into an academy 4 years ago (shit loads of money has been pumped into it to make it a better school as the school was only having 20% of the students getting 5 a*-c grades)<n>we moved into 'temporary buildings' while the old school was being knocked down and the new one was being built. this meant that the music department still had additional rooms for 'practice rooms'<n>i was in the top practice room with two people in my class. let's call them bob and sarah. 'bob' seems to think he can play guitar, and so that was why he was in
 my friend opened a store recently so my friend (not the store owner) and i decide to stop by and check some things out.<n>we walk in and two guys are at the counter talking with my friend who is the store owner.<n>as we walk up to the counter i notice a purse sitting on the floor so i immediatley say \hey i think some lady left her purse here!\ and i pointed at it.<n>no one said anything for the first few seconds. then one of the guys who were standing at the counter said \that's mine\
 as i go to cross the street to the station i can't see what's coming to the left of me because there is a bus in the way .<n>when i look the left of me and there is an ambulance headed straight for me .<n>my music was too loud to hear the sirens and now my shame is paying for it .
 yesterday i had my last of 6 finals and decided appropriate celebration was necessary, so i called up some of my friends to go smoke some weed.<n>after smoking, of course, came the munchies, and i didn't have much in my room except for some burger buns, but since i am baked and have the munchies, i figure, hey, why not?<n>i go up to my room and grab the buns and bring it back down to my friend's room where i begin to open it, until one of my friends says, \dude, why are the buns green and fuzzy?\<n>i look down,
 i asked a girl to my senior prom a couple weeks ago.<n>i bought the tickets, which totaled to $220. that's a pretty hefty commitment, yeah?<n> now i realize that both of these (basically) mandatory events are happening on the same night at the same time.<n>i have an idea for a plan to get replacements for the stage production, as i pretty much can't just cancel the prom (due to my commitment to my date, not to mention the financial involvement, which is hefty for my family)
 i've never known the like. hot watery shit exploding from my bum-holey. it goes on for a long time.<n>don't know how long it was before i staggered from the bathroom, white as a sheet, giant pupils, barely coherent and sweating like a virgin on a honeymoon. attractive.
 After a very heavy lunch i feel the need to drop a deuce .<n>My sister is notorious for occupying the bathroom for hours on end .<n>After nearly an hour and a half of waiting i let out the fiery coconutty deuce from my poor little asshole .

 I came home from class and found my dog sleeping in the middle of the kitchen floor .<n>when i went to check on him the first thing i noticed was that he had dried blood smeared around his lips and he reeked of death .<n>Normally the sliding door is kept closed to keep my dog going through the trash, but today i was in a rush and forgot to close it .<n>my dog went through the garbage and tore up two of my used pads. there was blood and cotton everywhere .
 after i left the bar and started heading home i made plans to hang out with another girl, d. now d and i had a very short fling a few months back which i ended as tactfully as I could.<n>for several reasons i do not care to elaborate on, d and i are simply not compatible on any level and i am not remotely attracted to her anymore.<n>then it called my friend max and left him a 6 minute voicemail. when i saw what happened, i sent m a quick text apologizing for pocket dialing her. she still hasn't responded to this day.
 my cousin and i ended up getting extremely whiskey drunk last night and i allegedly walked into her room and started pissing on her night stand while she slept less than a foot away .<n>they about kicked me out this morning. luckily i was able to stay.
 jalapenos are like a sleeper cell of spicy terrorists. they sneaked right past my tongue only to burn the everloving fuck out of my mud whistle.<n>i've felt afterburn from spicy foods before, but nothing like this. turns out those goddamned jalapenos were like a sleeper cell of spicy terrorists.
 i'm a 16 year old, shy lad, who just recently found out I have an amazingly warm, funny, and spontaneous personality .<n>i'm really angry at myself, and i'm completely distraught. i blame myself fully on this for putting her into this position, and i feel like absolute shit right now.<n>i'll be honest, there were subtle signs looking back, but i never really picked up on it at the time. now i'm stuck in this horrible position.
 One of the two lamps i chose to finger as a child burned my fingers and nails .<n>i was probably about seven at the time, no fucking clue how I managed to reach the socket .<n>the room smelled just as you'd expect, burning flesh .
 i'm a high schooler in an all-girl's gym class.<n>This week we were playing flag football, and man, i get into the sports we play.<n>i take two steps and collapse right on the spot.<n>i remember, however, them trying to get me to stand up for x-rays.<n>i stood up, felt completely fine, they got me in position for the x-rays... and i blacked out and puked. thankfully, in a puke bag.<n>i now have to wear this neckbrace for the next week and a half, and my sister's

 she's the worst relationship i ever had in my life. damaged me for years.<n>i directed her to take a different, better route home. as she wasn't familiar with it, she got well and truly lost. so she calls me in that panicky voice asking me to direct her back to safety.<n>While i was on the phone with her i got a call from a mate of mine. he called me 2-3 times as for whatever irrelevant reason, he really needed to talk to me.<n> me being the good bf i am i ignore my mates call so i can make sure my woman arrives safely

 i had no idea of what was to come of my fatal mistake .<n> with no toilet for miles (there wasn't one at the base of the trail), i had little choice but to become closer with nature .<n>after that we hiked for a while longer and then i went home, finished the job, and showered for a good 20 minutes .
 i work in an office building and every fucking door in this spot is locked with a keycard access.<n>i get to my department door, and these doors are magnetic lock, so i need to swipe my card to get in.<n>i give the door a little kick to open, but i slipped, and pretty much put my entire weight, plus 4 giant water jugs full behind it, and the door just stopped half way and closed again.<n>i put down the water bottles, slowly open the door, and see my coworker, laying on the floor, face full of blood, unconscious..<n>She has a
 A friend's family decided to put on a fireworks show on the beach for the fourth .<n>The idea was to shoot off nine mortars at a time .<n>The ninth mortar had a longer fuse, and got knocked over by the other eight blasts .<n>The girl who was hit was ok, but her mother gave her the stink eye the rest of the trip .
 since she's my grandmother, i can't really tell her how i feel without getting into a cussing storm that would make the ying-yang twins blush .<n>i write letters to people that annoy me without the intention of sending them .<n>when i was done, i saved it and called it \fuck you.\, closed out of it, then left to use the bathroom and call my dad to talk about when i would come over .<n>when i returned, i saw my grandmother crying and my mom trying to comfort her .

 i made the ill-thought idea to dump my girlfriend only a couple hours after her friend died in a hit-and-run .<n>well, she called me, crying about finding out she was single.<n>i really didn't want any confrontation, so i ended up taking her back .
 i was playing with the remote by slapping it on my stomach and after 10 minutes of doing so i missed my tummy some how and slapped my balls really hard.
 i had ordered some items for Christmas and had them shipped to my grandmothers to prevent my family members from seeing what i had gotten them .<n> fast forward a few weeks and she's having a christmas party for people at the state house, her place of work, and for the future speaker of the house .<n>after the party had started moving into the main room, we decided to go into one of the back room closets where the items i had ordered were put so they wouldn't get in the way of the party .<n>unknown to the three of us, my grandmother had decided to give a tour
 last week i got a letter from student finances saying my bill was way overdue and that if i didn't pay by the date stated, they'd either refer me to a collections agency or take up a case in small claims court.<n>Finally got a hold of somebody who'd said they called another office and informed them of the situation and told me to send an e-mail d just so they'd have it in writing. so i may or may not get a court summons sometime soon.
 when i open the cap i accidentaly break the little noozle .<n>the remaining end of the nozzle got stuck in the can and now it won't stop spraying .<n>the whole can emptied in maybe 30 seconds, so all i could do was to wrap it in a t-shirt .
 i started to feel like i was going to have to go to the bathroom, soon .<n>i was hysterical half crying/half almost laughing at the terrible circumstance i had found myself in .<n>i took a long hot shower, and broke down in hysterical crying off and on for a good while afterward .
 i was going to fill a condom with water and transport it outside to chill in the driveway. in my sleepy and feeble mind, it sounded like a good way to kill some time rather than doing anything constructive on this miserably hot day.<n>as it neared completion, it began to resemble an elephant's amniotic sac.<n>i was satisfied by this size and thought it would look marvelous as the new focal point of the driveway.<n>i then began to carry it as best i could to the front door. it was wibbly wobbling all over the place, which i found sort of entertaining until...**s
 i wanted to surprise them by setting fireworks off in the back yard and have them arc over the house so they could see them from the front window.<n>i light a rack of really thick, short fireworks (six in a rack with fuse connected to each so they go off in succession, one after the other, and angle them over the house at about 65-70 degrees, and let them rip. now, our back yard is long, but not wide, and i wanted to keep a fair distance from the house so the powder would not stink the place up.<n>the fireworks flew out nicely, really nicely, and arced
 i'm taking a team picture and all of them are talking and none are looking at the camera.<n>i get pretty pissed and sternly tell them they all need to look at the camera immediately.<n>i take another picture, said \great job, guys\, and left.
 The routine is simple: contacts, brush teeth and fix hair.<n>i don't spend 15 minutes on my hair, but i do make it look presentable for work.<n>i applied my hair gel to my toothbrush, stuck said brush in my mouth, and proceeded to clean away. about five seconds in, my mouth had a peachy, stinging sensation.<n>i proceeded to vomit about 10 seconds later because of how bad it was burning/had gotten in my throat.
 i lost my grip on the hairdryer and it fell toward my exposed boobs as i wasn't wearing a shirt .<n> my nipple made contact with the extremely hot metal grate and i swear i heard my flesh sizzling .
 i was removing nail polish from my nails during the loading screen before my last game. when the game started, all my attention was on that for 45 minutes.<n>i knocked over the bottle of acetone nail polish remover and spilled it in my lap. freaked out.<n> spilled somewhere around 200 ml/8 oz - half the bottle. stood up, left the room stark naked, tossing a paper towel roll at the bf.<n>i've never had a chemical burn before, but this was excruciating.
 today i went out to buy some groceries, and i took my bike as i'm wont to do when i go shopping.<n>when on the way home, just on on the slope up towards the apartment building, i notice my neighbour from the door across the hall from me getting out of their car.<n>my dumb self saw it as a good idea to wave at them, since i was listening to music.<n>i end up crashing the bike and fall flat on my face. good news: no broken bones, my face is intact and the groceries are ok.<n>well, i have a cut on my hand from
 i coughed up a whole bunch of turkey and somehow it got lodged in my nose .<n>before i can even run to the restroom or even pick up a napkin, the pepper that was on the turkey makes me sneeze a snot/turkey/mashed potato concoction all over the table .
 i was out camping with some friends in virginia when i was about 16 years old.<n>we had packed in our food, which in this case happened to be various canned things (notably, several varieties of spam)<n>our frontal lobes being undeveloped at the time, we placed these sealed cans of spam onto the campfire and went for a walk while we waited for it to heat up.<n>we got distracted while out and returned about an hour later, to see that our cans of food had assumed a mushroom-cloud-like shape as their boiling contents attempted to reach the outside world.
 i lived in the middle of nowhere and had only one neighbor who spoke russian so i had no communication with anyone.<n>i went to my neighbors house hoping i could use some sign language or something to explain the situation and ask if i could use their phone but of course, they weren't home.<n>at 10:00pm i thought \fuck it, lets just climb through the window.\ all the windows on the first floor are locked so i climb onto my roof via my porch.<n>Luckily the motion light turned on. on my roof i jumped onto my juliet balcony and tried that door and receive the same disappointing
 i went to a party and after about 5 hours some people were really drunk, i don't drink so i found it all hilarious and around this point someone had the brilliant idea to go the park .<n>Once i started going i realised that i wasn't going fast enough so i stood up to get off and slipped fell straight on my back .<n>everyone else found it hilarious, and now i can barely walk but walked back to the party, stayed there for another 20 minutes and went home in pain.
 after oversleeping a couple hours, i get to work an hour half late and get straight to doing my work .<n>my assignment today was to clean the mess from the construction (i work for a company that builds lifts in old apartments and the diamond saw makes a big ass mess)<n> anyway, i go to fill up my bucket of water but it doesn't seem to be running, and i notice someone had turned off the main water valve to the tap and somewhere else .<n>about half a minute later i hear shouting and two plumbers run towards me in panic. turns out there was a water cut while
 when he's in the neighborhood i invite him in for coffee .<n> today, i was supposed to babysit my best friend's kids, and i was expecting her to come by any minute .<n>So, expecting my friend, my dumbass self opens the door yelling \[hey daddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd8mxge6kek)!\
 this week is rush week for my fraternity, and tensions are high .<n>since i was no longer tied down by a work shift and all my classes were cancelled that day, i readily volunteered to help with the set up .<n>i lay over a trash can asking for ice and something to hold back the flow until i got a ride to the emergency room, which was a 5 minuted drive away .<n>part of the nail went with the tip, and it was a slightly diagonal cut, but it didn't take out too much flesh .
 i work as the weekend manager for a project hp is doing. weekends tend to be very slow so occasionally i come in a little hungover from the night before .<n>well today was like any other weekend morning.<n>i get in at 8 greet everyone go to my desk and start munching on my breakfast burrito.<n>i send some emails and give the agents some busywork.
 i ran out of snow from the mountain i was digging into, so i start shoveling on the snow pile next to mine .<n> turns out, i was stealing her private property, and wanted to be compensated for stealing, her snow .<n>i spoke to the cops, it went down like this (she went back inside at that point, watching from the window like she \got me\)<n>i then proceed to show the second cop, who was inside talking to the wonderful neighbor i have, the epic snow fort, thinks it's pretty neat, since it's the first fort he's been
 i drove up to a taco truck to get a burrito.<n>a homeless man asked to wash my windshield.<n>He said that he's not going to beg for money and that he's willing to work for it.<n>i ignored him at first, but i decided that since he seemed like a nice guy, i was going to get something for him.
 last night it was a sleety, snowy mess.<n>my road and the adjacent road are a bit slushy still because they aren't main roads and cleared often.<n>i'm driving for about 30sec around 30mph (should've been going slower ik, but i'm not speeding or going the speed limit here)<n>come down the hill around a bend, lose control, fishtail and proceed to go into the yard of a nearby house, across their driveway, and back out onto the road.
 microwave pasta! just take a big plastic bowl, put the dry pasta in, add water, and microwave on full power for 12 min.<n>i was also cooking sausages in a skillet, and doing a shit job of it. they were burning quite badly. soon enough, the room filled with smoke.<n>i took the bowl out to check, which **filled** the room with burnt plastic. now my eyes started to sting, and it was difficult to breath.<n>i threw the bowl and the bottom-of-the-bowl-that-was-melted-onto-the-microwave-plate away
 i work in a biology lab at my university and my main job is to set up labs and wash beakers .<n> lately i've been helping a professor do research and part of it is sterilizing deionized water in the autoclave .<n>a few days ago i was putting the water into the machine and i sort of forgot which button to push so i took an educated guess and pushed the one that i thought was the button for the right cycle.<n>for some reason my stupid head told me that it was supposed to heat up to full temperature before i put my stuff in there which makes no sense
 My first time trying to get a tampon in ended with me in tears as i didn't really know what to do .<n>i left the dog i was babysitting in our entryway (the only place inside he was allowed)<n>i threw a pad on my underwear, hobbled to my room with a towel around my waist, and got a change of clothes.<n> cleaned up the bathroom, took some advil, washed my hands, and decided good riddance to bad rubbish.
 last night technically, but it was around midnight so whatever. also, only a minor fuck up but still.<n>well, one of my friends announced on his facebook the other day that he'll be having a party today, sunday, in the afternoon. he sends me a message around midnight, saying that i'm invited.<n>well, i have an always-on desktop. facebook is almost always on/showing as available because of that. but i had gone to sleep about an hour before he messaged me.
 my gf decided to come visit me (1 hr drive) after getting her **brand new car** less than a month ago .<n>at the gas station, she has trouble backing up into a vacant spot by the pump .<n>i then proceed to somehow slam the fucking accelerator, backing up into a trashcan and then into the concrete partition, creating a quarter sized hole in the center of the metallic gash .
 I was driving my friends to a club when I saw a strange woman in the grass .<n>She had lost her phone and her keys but had enough to drink .<n>She agreed to let me take her back to her dorm .<n>My friends demanded I bail on my new ward and accommodate the original plans .<n>I am certain that my better judgement has cost me a preciously cherished friendship .
 today he sent me a text saying he was back home for a while .<n>i asked him if he was on vacation and he replied saying that not really, he was there to take care of his dad who has cancer and that because of that he got a few weeks off work so he could do that .<n>i was only half paying attention to what he was saying and texting him while texting other people that i was more interested in talking to, so i just replied : \ah, how nice... hope you have an awesome time!\
 i didn't know that meant it was the /only/ tip you were going to give.<n>i planned to give her more of a tip. so she comes back, kind of throws my check down in front of me and says, \sir, i don't need your quarter\ real snarky.<n>i immediately feel horrible, realizing she thought that was going to be her only tip from me.
 i got a virus that was going through my family, my mother and brother were at home in bed with it for a few days .<n>because i was drugged up on medicine and was feeling slightly better, i thought, why not?<n>because i was hesitant on eating the chocolate, but after i started, everything seemed fine .<n>i woke up at 3.30 in the morning to what felt like my stomach twisting itself in a knot, i jumped up straight away and bolted for the toilet .<n>for the next half an hour, i was hunched over the toilet, feeling like i was going to explode from both ends
 a few months ago, went on a trip to vegas i kept secret from my parents, had an incredible time, but was also bombarded by the corner guys shoving cards with nude photos of girls in your hands.<n>no big deal put them in my dress pants.<n>fast forward, my great grandmother past away after 93 years this week and i flew out to attend her funeral and took my dress pants.<n>just to make matters worse my extended family is super conservative. long story short, pants were being ironed and my whole family got so see some porn pictures fall out of my pants.
 i drew \u00a310 out of the atm this evening to pay for my half of the pizza.<n>i then proceeded to take my card from the atm and leave the \u00a310. when i got back it was gone and i had to draw another \u00a310 to pay for the pizza.
 today i got fired from my job de to friday i got a late invite to big day out and there was no way i was going to miss red hot chilli peppers .<n>i texted my boss i hurt my back and couldn't come in and purposely didn't make any facebook status or subject but only to realise today that i was tagged on a status from a friend when i should've checked this so i could've untagged myself .
 she hated surprises, well more of knowing there was a surprise without knowing what it was .<n>at one point she was going through some serious depression and when the idea sparked i kinda just casually mentioned that if i could get it all together, i'd do something nice for her .<n>then came the constant asking. \tell me what it issss! pleeeeease???\ \tell me!\ \oh, come oooonnn.\
 \i mean, you get my semen in you and that's also mucous.\ needless to say, that's why i'm laying here typing this up for your amusement instead of getting laid. you're welcome.
 i am an idiot regardless though.<n>i need a shot of a candle on a black backdrop.<n>i head upstairs and grab a candle, it is a simple white one.<n>i also grab a lighter, and then head back to the studio downstairs to start shooting.<n>i start trying to light the candle, and it doesn't smell good and it's starting to spark, i just assume this is one dumb-ass candle and it will light eventually.
 the boyfriend and i went to visit his grandparents because we are nice people.this is my first time meeting them and i was kinda nervous but they were pretty nice and i survived.grandma wanted a handshake before i left so naturally i obliged.<n>i walked away wondering why my hand was sticky.then i remember like 20 minutes before bf and i pulled over to take take of some business.pants business.didn't wash hands after.
 I had a craving for something spicy so i picked up some chicken wings from a pizza shop.<n>i get home, eat the wings while redditing a bit, take a shower, say goodnight to my husband, and head to bed around 2 am.<n>at about 5 i wake up with this stabbing pain in my upper belly, right between the lower w of my ribs.
 woke up this morning and the 'itch' was still there. wrapped my finger around some toilet paper and i felt the dreaded bump.<n>i now have a hemorrhoid.
 i took a client to a lake to discuss all sorts of business for winktiddlers. we ended up basically having a picnic and not short thereafter he gets a phone call.<n>my client ended up seeing me and with my sketchbook and came over. he told me that he isn't sure if buying x item wouldn't be a good idea for him but that he'd keep it in mind.
 as a bisexual, i am all for gay rights, but i've never been a big fan of people on the streets just insisting on you to register and give them money .<n>i am in a hurry to go out to do something, and the phone rings for me, which is odd since i don't live there.<n>i picked it up and hear a very electronic voice on the other side: \hi! we are calling you on behalf of the gay rights blablabla association to...\<n>i immediately felt like a complete asshole for doing so and could never call the number back and had no
 i bought a pair of koss sx-30 speakers from woot.com a few days ago. they arrived today .<n>i went out and bought a 6v dc adapter like it said, plugged it in, turned it on... and nothing.<n> nowhere in the instructions does it say an level for the adapter, so i got a 6v/1a adapter, thinking it would be fine. however, no sound comes out at all.
 my lady has cats and dogs in her house. she keeps a grumpy old cat in her room to keep him from fighting with the others.<n>i am very allergic to cats and will break out in hives from skin contact.<n>i asked them to flip the blanket over to avoid getting cat hair all over me, but lo and behold that shit was everywhere.
 crystal light is a powder you put in your water to make it taste amazing .<n>It also turns into this gelatin like substance when it gets moist but hasn't dissolved .<n>The flavour i used was raspberry so it was red... and actually looked like blood .
 my friend was having a bad day, thinking she was good for nothing.<n>i was sitting right beside her, trying to cheer her up, and i was going to give her a hug and tell her she's perfect, when i drove my elbow onto her nose really, really hard.<n> nosebleeding all over the place! so. much. blood.
 i provided some students a proxy to allow them to get on sites that are blocked at school along with some games such as halo a super mario brawl clone and some emulators.<n>most people got about 1 day iss some got 2 depending on how much you used. they have not called me up to the office yet however however i think they will on Monday.<n>Also they banned the use of flash drives for some people. school.
 i had what felt like food poisoning, and it was rather nasty. once i got home from work i abandoned all my plans, wound up in the bathroom exploding from both ends.<n>i thought it was food poisoning, like i said.<n>i stay in bed most of the morning, completely sick to my stomach.<n>i get up, use the restroom, and with the most satisfying explosive diarrhea you can imagine i felt the sickness drain out of my ass.
 i play roller derby, and on dec 1st i was skating in my very first bout.<n>it's our first bout of the season, so everyone's nervous and excited.<n>since i'm a rookie, all of the vet skaters start telling me their bout-prep rituals, like painting their fingernails white (to prevent injury? lol)<n>i turned down the nail polish but accepted the jack3d. here lies my folly.
 I'm 15 years old, not a swagfag, not a yolo rageer and (i hope) not immature/obnoxious .<n>I was working with a friend who i met when he was new to the school .<n>He seemed like a relatively good friend except for one detail .
 i went to the chiropractor and after they are done popping your joints they hook up to these two electrode things on your lower back .<n>The idea is to kind of half ass short circuit your nerve endings and also loosen and strengthen up the muscles .<n>The problem is though no matter how high you start it out at it, it doesn't feel like much 30 seconds later .
 My dad and i decided to take the bicycle-only path, because the place was packed .<n>However, we notice a variety of people on the path, and despite a hint of agitation, we let them do their thing and go off on our way .<n>They decided that it's okay to walk in a 3x1 path that's only 4x1 .<n>i quickly try to swerve around a guy who's coming at me in full force, and while doing so, manages to sideswipe into the ditch, and wipe out on the gravel .
 gilby the pitbull attacked detroit and gallagher .<n>gilby bit me on the arm (lovely jaw-shaped punctures and bruises there), the hands several times, and my elbow .<n>gilby was spot-free; detroit only dripped a few drops from the first round, and gallagher, the saint he is, never got involved and was fine.
 i woke up with a really big stomach ache.<n>last night i was up until the wee hours of the am battling the ss diarrhea in my stomach.<n>i finally got to bed, and all was done.<n>i debated on staying home from school today, but i realized the end of the first quarter was upon me.<n>i had a fairly large government test i couldn't afford to miss.
 when will i learn?<n>my gas light came on today while driving to my second job but i thought \i have enough to make it there and back, i'll fill up when I get home.\ turns out, i only had enough to make it a quarter of the way home before running out of gas on the side of a mountain.
 i am going to college to get a degree in teaching and for one of my current classes we each had to give a presentation about school discipline .<n>for one of my current classes we each had to give a presentation about school discipline.<n>so later i show [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgbjq1esdhu) to prove a point in a wacky and funny way. everyone was laughing and enjoying the video, everyone but one person, who was actually a friend of mine.
 last week was my sister's birthday and like any good brother i didn't bother getting her anything until the last minute .<n>Knowing i had to put something in the post i used my phone to take a photo of her address which hangs on a notice board in my kitchen .<n>off i went to the card shop armed with a pen, stamps and the sort of gift buying motivation you can only get the day before someone's birthday .<n>i found a nice card and bought her a gift voucher for nice things, playing it safe as i have no idea what she actually likes these days .<n>
 i was scheduled to give blood at 11:15 which was 20 minutes after lunch so i had plenty of food in me.<n>i was having a conversation with a friend when the next thing i know the room is spinning and i make my way back to the lounging chair thing i was in.<n>i then proceeded to throw up for the next 10 minutes and feel like death for an hour after that.
 i left my window open the whole way for the night. it's been open since morning. but no big deal.<n>i was browsing reddit and doing a little programming on my ipad when i started to notice a couple of little black bugs lattracted to the light of my device. more than normal.<n>i turned the light on and found the little fucker sitting on my desk. too close to the tissues for me to grab one and smush it, but far enough away from the rubber bands that i could use them.<n>i turned around to see hundreds of those microscopic black fucks having a party around
 since i'd only eaten once today so far, i was rather hungry .<n>ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread, sweet potato fries with a maple bacon bbq sauce, pretzels with beer cheese and several brews to wash it all down .<n>i came home and had several brownies that were conveniently been left out on the counter .<n>while watching hockey early this evening, i felt another one of my atomic farts coming on and like a fool i trusted it as i had all the others .
 i do all sorts of aircraft, from commercial passenger planes and private jets to helicopters, private light aircraft and police/medivac planes .<n>i had just gotten the hang of doing all the paperwork and driving the big fuel trucks and learning the different fuel points on the variety of aircraft when my 'incident' happened today .<n>i was by myself for this but had done these almost every day i worked here, \no problem\
 My kids bought me a small device that makes maddeningly short, faint noises at totally random intervals and can run for 3 months on a watch battery .<n>When it was found it was brought to the branch manager, who then sent pictures of the device to me .<n>the manager couldn\u2019t identify it but guessed it might be a listening device so he sent the pictures to the rcmp corporate crimes division .
 \little tifuthwaway\ wasn't very happy with me and was asking for some attention .<n>i didn't expect my girlfriend to come walking in to tell me that dinner was ready .<n>i haven't gotten many words from her in the last 3 hours and dinner was very weird .
 last year i went to summer school and made up the credits that I had to .<n>This year i passed all my classes so here i am thinking i'm golden, on track to celebrate with all my friends.<n>Last year we didn't go over the other credits i have to make up before i can graduate, a grand total of 5 credits.<n> summer school only allows you to make up 3 credits in a summer. so i have to go to at least 2 different summer school programs, which may have to be at night.<n> quitting my job means i will have to live at home next year instead
 i am known for being conservative and sweet, and happy but hands-to-myself when drunk.<n>a few days ago, i was with a group of friends, including the guy i am in love with and who has feelings for me, and everyone was getting a little tipsy.<n>i decided to up the ante on everyone and drink as much vodka as i could, temporarily forgetting that vodka kind of makes me insane.<n>i drank more than half the bottle in a couple hours and got the kind of rowdy no one really wants to witness.
 i'd never attempted this before, but proceeded (with great care) with the only razor in the house at the time - dad's face one, but he was never going to find out .<n>i later got a call from my mum, yelling down the phone 'what did you shave this morning, the drains are completely blocked!'. so i was like 'umm, my face'. she didn't buy this, so i hung up.<n>i later went home to find my dad, the voice of reason - 'i'd rather you hadn't used my face razor, but
 today i got called in to manage one of the stores i work in because the gm had an emergency (her 16 year old son was stabbed by a girl at school). now scheduled to work a 12 1/2 hour shift while already behind, i began to feel the effects of the stress.<n>i'm probably ovulating because i'm horny as fuck.<n>i managed to get a break in during the afternoon and went out to my car to smoke (it was raining and i had no other protection)<n>thought to myself \hey know what would be such a good idea? why don't you rub
 The bouncer was so much fun today she decided that the bouncer was so much fun it didn't matter.<n>It was on her onesie, on the bouncer's seat, on the side of her leg- a pretty typical blowout, right?<n>The carpet took a ton of scrubbing, but carpet cleaner for pet poop works just as good for baby poop.
 last night's dream was crazy detailed, and seemed more real than anything i've ever experienced.<n>i watched my cousin stab my other cousin in the chest, he's 7.<n>i spent the rest of the time trying to get a refund for my ticket to disney world, and i was covered in blood, so it wasn't an easy task.<n>i woke up sweating and jumping out of bed ready to go to the police or take some sort of action.<n>didn't want to go into too much detail, but i still remember every second of the events of the dream.
 i'd recently passed my driving test and thought i'd go for a drive on some country roads .<n>i was relatively new to driving and thought neither car could fit on the road if we were to pass .<n>the other car passed me, however on my side of the road, there was a deposit of mud along by the bank, where tractors had come out of a turning into a farm .<n>by slamming the brakes on, i veered past the oncoming car and into a metal pole .
 i don't remember what prompted it, but she was playfully poking her finger around my face and i was acting like i was going to bite it to make her stop!<n>well the first two times she moved her hand back quickly and i expected the same on the third, but instead she didn't move her finger, and i actually closed my mouth around it. realizing what was happening, i didn't bite down, but rather slid off so it turned into more of a lick/suck.
 i begin to think i am the fireball king... sadly, i am not.<n>we begin to walk up a set of brick steps leading to my friend's domicile..<n>i fall backwards down about 20-something steps, landing in a crumpled heap... i tell my friend to \leave me here, i'm ok\ (picture this in some sort of sappy, wwi-esque manner)<n> friend drags me inside, fall asleep on couch, piss myself during the night wake up in the morning, sore as fuck, and unable to stand on my left ankle because of extreme pain.
 i was feeling really bloated and backed up, and being the hypochondriac that i am, i went and popped laxatives without even thinking twice about my actions .<n>half way through my work out, i start feeling the tell-tale laxative cramps .<n>i wake up and run, butt cheeks clenched, to the bathroom .<n>i try to flush as quietly as possible to avoid waking up anyone else in the house .<n>i put everything back, and by the time i get back to bed, it's 6:43am, and i had been out of bed for 2 1/2 hours trying to
 i have a hair trimmer with various length plastic attachments, the kind that have pointy ends.<n>well, i will just say that the pointy ends of a trimmer attachment can quickly puncture a nut sack, which started dripping blood profusely pretty much immediately.<n>after showering i was still bleeding a little, so i decided to clean it with rubbing alcohol.<n>Here i sit 2 hours later with dried blood on my ball sack, hoping it heals fast, and i'm also hoping i didn't puncture anything too important.
 i've been playing a game where i try to hit her in the tits, neck, or face with my cum--which i did that night, but for all the wrong reasons.<n>the next morning when i get up to pee, i experience, hands down, the worst pain in my life.<n>imagine razor blades being forced down your urethra (some of you sick fucks probably do this for fun) while you unless a hot stream of post-coital piss.<n>i couldn't stand up after my pee, and when i looked at my leadbelly, it looked like blind willie
 After my workout i really needed to take a shower. no problem so far .<n>being lazy and not wanting to move i try to turn the water back on while pressing against the wall of my shower. now, to avoid turning into an ice cube i turn the temperature knob quickly and without a second thought all the way to the warm side. this turned out to be a bad idea. because now the water is steaming hot and runs over most of my body; turning my chest into the color of a well done lobster and burning my balls.
 as i'm leaving i see a girl walking up to me and she seems pretty excited to see me and shouts my name .<n>i respond with \hey, i know you\ and she thinks i'm joking about not knowing her name and laughs it off .<n>now i feel like a dick and she's not very impressed .
 i am refinishing a bench i got from my neighbor's trash (don't judge me)<n>i put stain/poly on the boards for it and then went to wash the brush.<n>for some reason i thought washing the brush bare-handed was a good idea, and proceeded to fan out the brush with my hands under the water.<n>i called my dad, the all-knowing about tools, paint, etc. he told me to grab some mineral spirits and use that on my hands to get the stain/poly off, after laughing at my stupidity.
 i'm a 16 year old girl with no car and a crazy libido.<n>well, yesterday i woke up and had had enough; enough of using the showerhead and getting yelled at for taking an hour to bathe, enough of humping pillows and shoving a sharpie up my butt to get the job done. enough!<n>i am a sexual being and i deserve a decent sexual experience! but... but, coochbuzzthrowaway, why don't you just ask your mommy to get you one?<n>i blush when people i don't know well talk to me, when i was little i'd literally
 i forgot my umbrella was on the ground.<n>i tripped up and completely fell on the old lady making her down on the ground, me on top her on the bottom.<n>when i had fallen on her, a giant un-ladylike fart (or at least i hope it was a fart)<n>it took me, the bus driver and three other guys to try and help her up and she eventually managed to stand.
 i'm the vp corporate relations and sponsorships at my university.<n>In a meeting with a faculty member, he asks me to bring up my research and stuff so we can discuss potential targets.<n>in the middle of the meeting, he asks me to bring up my research and stuff so we can discuss potential targets.<n>i had the document open on one desktop and i was taking notes on another desktop. instead of swiping 3 fingers to the left, i accidentally swiped my fingers upwards and so there was my background photo.<n>my background was [this](http://pds.exblog.jp/pds
 one of my friends was in town and was crashing at my place.<n>we'd handled a 6 pack and a vodka at home and were starting to feel the munchies around 12:30.<n> conveniently, it was time for the last of the dog's trifecta of walks for the day so we decided that we'd grab some food to go and then take her to the dog park.
 as long as i have known this man i knew he was a pot-smoker, but never knew he was a meth addict.<n>i guess it all makes sense now, because he can rebuild a car or bike engine in one night. (on meth i'm guessing)
 i have a plastic bag with two (rather large) toys and two containers of lube.<n>i put this under my mattress and today my grandpa and i were putting carpet in my room. we move the bed and i realize my mistake right as we're removing the top mattress.<n>my grandfather is on the other side of the bed where the plastic bag was.<n>he quickly realizes what it is and puts the bag to the side, making no comment to the contents; he can only guess whether the toys are for me or my so.
 i went out with a girl i've been seeing the past few years for a photo shoot- she's a model and i had never seen her work before.<n>i took her out for a burger and everything went great. until the actual shoot started that is.
 victoria's secret model wanted to go to a movie theater right after our shifts ended .<n>we rushed from work to the theater, and she picked our seats at the very top of the theater stairs .<n>the steps were odd (3 small steps and then 1 big step), and i somehow started running but couldn't stop .<n>thank god for that seat near the bottom of the stairs, catching my knee and sending me ass over wetting down in front of the whole audience .<n> update 1: texted her after the movie. she said she had a lot of fun hanging out with me, and would like
 i've been smacking the chicken dry, and i've never tried lube before.<n> so i went into the kitchen and found a small container to hold the lube back to my room.<n>it was a big plastic cap, like [this](http://www.m-p.com/pipeprotection/large%20cap.jpg), but it was indeed better than smacking it dry, but more messy.
 i left a can of the good stuff in my coldest box and now my tongue's just drooping out of my mouth like a sick animal .<n> sandwich cookers are the worst balls. fuck this life and \budder it\ with a knife .
 my house has had a ant problem for years and what ever we do these fuckers will not go away so today i was cleaning the kitchen and i found a hole where they were coming in and out from so i decided i wanted to pump something up into that hole and make those hell spawn suffer.<n>i went and looked for something we have never used and i got the bright idea to use hand sanitizer... so i get on my knees to get to the hole and i point the tip where the sanitizer comes out of up at the ant hole under that counter and start pumping the sanitizer into the hole.
 i'm pretty well lit so i swoop in and pick this tiny girl up (one arm under the legs and one behind her back) and it's all fun'n'games .<n>set her down, go to pick her friend up and drunkenly fail, resulting in us tumbling forward and me landing on her .<n>She laughs and asks \what the fuck man!\ and i replied \you're too heavy!\
 Someone reported my umbrella to the police .<n>It was possible that there was an actual threat on campus, but it was also very likely that it was just an honest mistake .<n>after a sweep of the building, they lifted shelter-in-place and let me go on my way .
 after 30 minutes of waiting, i text my brother \i don't even care if this asshole shows up at this point, im gonna leave on principle alone\<n>a moment of sheer panic washes over me as i freeze deciding what to do. still no response.<n>i call him - he answers the phone with a friendly tone and asks if im coming in, apparently he was a little late and came into the office when i had gone to the bathroom while waiting.
 i'd just eaten Italian food so i figured some little piece of meat sauce like flew off my plate when i was scraping the little bits of sauce into the trash can .<n>i get to the bathroom, get the stain in some light, and i think to myself *no, that can't be...* ***but what if it is?!*** so i get the little thing on a sheet of toilet paper and give the little brownie a smell. yep, i just pooped a bit on my pinky toe.
 i think he wants to kill me. i mean, i think he wants to kill me.<n>i pull open the window and poke him gently with the slat, close the window and go to the front door to unlock it.<n>i see stan following me outside through the windows. i open the door for him, and he strides in the embodiment of drunken fury, motioning at me with the hedge-scissors and cursing at me in russian while josh laughs his ass off.<n>this is the final epic in the trilogy of poor stanislav, godfather of my boyfriend josh and unfortunate victim of
 i was watching netflix on my ps3 and using my laptop while relaxing in my huge recliner chair.<n>well my laptop was resting about the middle of my stomach and didn't think that it would cause a problem if i would arch my back to stretch it.<n>Here's where i fuck up; after stretching my legs i arch my back high off the chair and immediately began to yawn, without thinking i take my hands off the laptop and put them over my head to complete the stretch.<n>turns out the grip on my laptop wasn't as good as i remembered, the fucker slid off of
 i tend to get my business done in the morning to avoid having to piss in a used toilet. last night, however, was different.<n>i'm lactose intolerant but indulged in ice cream anyway, resulting in stomach cramps.<n>i suddenly needed to evacuate my bowels, so off to the toilet i go. keep in mind the toilet has not been flushed yet today.<n>i walk in the bathroom and sit down. wrong move. so instead of sitting on the toilet, i fall in.
 i had my first interview with a job three weeks ago. they were great and called me back the next week to schedule a second interview.<n>well, when i looked at the calendar i placed the 27th, in my brain, on friday.<n>i don't know what my brain did or why, but i continued thinking that the 27th was on friday. obviously, it's not. so at around 11 a.m. this morning i realized my error with a thundering horrifying realization.
 An hour into my shift i was walking down an aisle and without any sort of warning my body decided that it couldn't hold back the tides any more .<n>i awkwardly shuffled/ran to the bathroom, and spent the next half hour mopping myself up and trying to save the thoroughly shit-stained dockers .<n>used his box cutter to slice a 6 inch rip in his pants .
 i am already in a relationship with a girl, but yesterday went horribly wrong.<n> lets call my gf \a\ and the other girl \b\<n>i just don't know what to do. some people say a is a stuck up bitch and i should leave her for b. fortunately, or unfortunately, i am not that type of guy. haven't slept... too busy thinking about it.
 this week i am on night shift working 2300-0700. normally i catch the train to and from work as this allows me to get an extra two hours sleep each day which is rather helpful.<n>This afternoon when i wake ip i realise i was in such a hurry to get home i wore my uniform home so i need to wear it back up.<n>Fast forward to 2215 i'm at work in the control room and all of a sudden i have to shit bad.<n>huge mistake every second step i take i can feel my asshole open.<n>in mid twirl i can't hold it anymore and
 i'm a 20 year old male working at a start-up shan't name for privacy .<n>having already pissed once an hour or two ago, i didn't have that much pee to get out of me .<n>After i was done i reached down and pulled my pants back up to notice that my underwear and pants were damp .<n>i couldn't just leave the washroom holding my wet underwear in hand in full view of my colleagues and boss looking like a toddler after downing a gallon of gatorade .
 i was masturbating and came up to my orgasm when i found a golf ball sized wiffle ball .<n>i tried and tried to wrap my fingers around it to pull all to no avail!<n>i truly expected the lube made in my gennies would suffice for removing the ball, but oh, was i wrong.<n>i grabbed the first thing i saw which was a pair of rusty pliers .<n>i realized that i needed to hook one of the holes so i grabbed a paper clip from my desk, bent it with the pliers and went fishing .
 i started browsing reddit while my sister checked her phone. about 5 minutes later my sister went out and played with one of here newly found friends and i was left alone in the room.<n>in just 3 minutes i thought i heard my parents footsteps in the corridoor.<n>if my parents found out that i was fapping i would probably kill myself, so i paniced and while i sprung from the toilet seat my arm decided to play a prank on me and pushed the computer off the basin and down on the floor.<n>there were a large crash and it all happend so fast that i managed to squeeze my
 ouch my reputation. i've lost. man, i am 180cm tall, weigh 82kg and not deprived by physical power. mate is about 155cm tall and weighs about 50kgs.<n>after witnessing how fun the principal accidentally spits when he screams at someone, we excused each other, cause there wasn't any real point of fighting - we just went over the boiling point - but now my school reputation is completely lost and i think i need to move to the other school.
 i was invited to a frat party by a hot chick from class .<n>We had a great time drinking, flirting and making out .<n>After a few thrusts i feel it getting warm, but kept going, then all of a sudden i can't move .<n>my hand is stuck on her ass, my dick is also stuck in her ass .<n>i recently found out that there was super glue in the vaseline because there was a guy who lived in the house who always denied fapping and they wanted to catch him red handed .
 my boss noticed what happened, and immediately started freaking out.<n>unfortunately for me, this box was a panic button of sorts, and a swat team was now on it's way.<n>Fast forward five minutes, and we had a burly swat guy with a massive gun patrolling our store right before the dinner rush started.
 i'm sorry for not getting this out sooner (if anyone did actually want to know the outcome of my fuck up) but it turns out that i'm only getting a write up since it was a mistake.<n> loss prevention team came in checked the cameras to see if it was on purpose or not and basically just said don't let it happen again.
 the other members of my group decided to just film it and have me edit it so i don't get 0% on the project .<n>my friend said he would send me the footage, but he didn't get home to send me it until late .<n>Now he is pissed off at me because i didn't edit it, and the rest of my group won't talk to me .
 i was sent to train some people on a new company program at a store i used to work at. it has been about five years since i worked at that location and its about an hour away so i never see any of the people i used to work with.<n> waiting on my first group to come in i was just chatting with a few people when this girl walked up and i said \ohh hey looks like you're getting ready to pop another one out huh?\
 i was informed of the fraternity by a friend of mine who was already a part of it and told me to go to meetings.<n>i went through hell and back trying to find professional attire for the mixer and the interview i had scheduled with them this past friday.<n>On the day of my interview i went early and was called in and made it through it fairly well. that same night, i get a call from my friend who originally informed me about the frat to meet him outside in the quad near where i dorm.<n>he congratulates me and hands me a letter with my acceptance to pledge for the quarter and we
 \Apparently This Matters\ is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at what's trending online .<n>This week, Jarrett investigates the cause of his toilet blockage .<n>\Apparently This Matters\ airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT .
 i work at a state liquor store and we usually keep candy for kids and treats for dogs under the front counter .<n>well today a scraggly looking ruffian says \you got any treats for my boys\ i assume/ hope he means his dogs.<n>\sure\ says my coworker \but these new one are peanut butter\
 i was about to be a freshman at a large public university and had made friends with a girl off of the facebook group of said university.<n>we chatted over the summer every day, and i developed a crush on her.<n> fast-forward to the first day of the school year.<n>my parents drove me up to my new home, a 3 hour drive. by the time we arrived i was feeling quite sick to my stomach.<n>i ate crackers and felt a little better. eventually my parents left, and i climbed into bed.<n>this would be my first time meeting her in person.
 i was at the front counter and began running my credit card for the advil and breath mints (i had just eaten sushi).<n>i go to let out a little far (surely it won't be too big)<n> casually, i ask the location of the restroom and if the cashier can hold my stuff for me.<n>i waddled to the can on my tiptoes, holding back the invading forces for the length of the store.
 i got a job as a graphic designer making 18$ hr, buy only 30 hrs a week. i needed a job and this seemed better than nothing.<n>i got a letter in the mail saying i was accepted as a full time employee at the state job, but i had to reply by December 20th.<n>the post office decided to forward my mail to me yesterday. not really my fuck up, but i loose anyway making 2x+ as much as i do at my current job because they didn't forward my mail.
 after acquiring this package i decided to go ahead and sell a few grams so I could get some money back .<n>Instead, he gave me the money and his keys so i could put the gram in his car.<n>his car is a dark blue semi-sporty vehicle with a soft cover, and a stuffed animal alligator sitting on the dash.<n>i got inside, put the weed in the glove compartment, returned his keys, and then left.
 i was taking care of business when one of the cats decides to push her way in and see whats up which at first i don't think much of.<n>until she comes up to me looking like she is about to rub up against my leg.....but no she decides to pee on me.
 last night my girlfriend and I had sex in her mother's apartment .<n>Her mother is paralyzed on the left side of her body after a stroke .<n>The only real spot to have sex in her apartment is the bed .<n>i stumbled forward a bit and my load flew and hit her mother while she was asleep .
 last night, i went to a mardi gras ball and ate a little too much junk.<n>this morning, i wasn't feeling well and vomited around 6:30.<n>my parents were leaving for work and i tried to go back to sleep when they left. about a half hour later, i felt like i had to vomit again so i went to the bathroom.<n>i began to chuck, and some diarrhea began to come out the other end with each heave.<n> grandpa came to the rescue with anti-diarrheal and a suppository, the latter of which i did not take.
 i was flattered so i went all out snapped all day and throughout the night, reception and all .<n>i even got my video camera and recorded the ceremony, speeches, activities, and i secretly interviewed everyone so that i could put together a wedding video of everything as a surprise .<n>i spent at least an entire day editing photos, video, and audio, and made my first mistake by not keeping copies of anything after transferring .
 her friend tweeted that she was having a bad day so me thinking ill make it better decide to go to her house and drop off her gift .<n>So i pull up to her moms apartment and ring the doorbell, she is not there and i cant really leave a rabbit there because some days she sleeps at her moms boyfriends house across town, and the nights are getting cold.<n>So i decide to wait ten or so minutes, i have a cigarette and set in for a wait, like two minutes into it her mom pulls up with my girlfriends friend in the passenger and my lady in the back, i see the
 my older brother was eating lasagne opposite me and blowing on a bit of it on his fork.<n>i waited a few seconds before he took in a deep breath and did it again, me getting more and more pissed.<n>\it's not that hot!\ i complained to him, resulting with him looking up and saying, \you try eat a piece from the middle\<n>i took a big bite of it right from the middle and began chewing it, maintaining eye contact.
 i work at a local Italian place washing dishes and cooking .<n>during these shifts, we get to lock the doors and take a roughly 20 minute break and eat what's left of the buffet .<n>Someone brings up how the way the boss asked if she could pick up an extra shift next week could be misinterpreted to ask if she was a stripper .<n>i bet you would make an amazing stripper.\ after making this remark and immediately regretting it, she gives me the most \you are weird as fuck' look, i awkwardly fast walk around the corner, she leaves, and the other guy proceeds to give
 found a water bottle on bench in kitchen, about a 1/3 of clear liquid left in it, obviously water so i top that bad boy up with cordial and head to uni.<n>start drinking in lecture to drop a couple of painkillers for my back and notice a distinctly coconut flavour that my cordial usually doesn't have... fast forward post lecture; off chops.
 i guess i was having a nightmare about being attacked by a small animal (about the size of a squirrell)<n>i woke up, thought my right hand was a small animal attacking me, and attempted to kill it by smashing it on the ground. now its all sore from where it hit the ground.<n>years back, when i lived with my parents, the same 'attacked by a small animal' dream occurred, except that i began beating my bedside lamp with a pillow, sure that it had been trying to kill me.
 when people do this it's usually blatantly obvious they want to overtake you .<n>i dropped into 3rd gear and sped up, closing the gap between me and the car infront of me so he couldn't squeeze in .<n>he just kept driving along at a level speed on the wrong side of the road until he had to drop in behind me before getting crushed by incoming traffic .<n>it wasn't until we stopped before a roundabout that i saw him pull up his handbrake and open the door to come drag me out of the car .
 when i first started riding with him, i always though, *he's going so fast!* not anymore...<n>i have been asking my dad to go on a ride with me, but up until now, he said *no*. before today, if drove his girlfriend at about 35 mph and she had an awesome time.<n> once we got to a certain point, he screamed into my ear, \okay! turn around!\<n>i stopped very fast and then he said, \jeez, trevon.\ he told me to let him drive home.
 i was just finished banging my lovely lady friend. we haven't gotten to do it in a while as she was on a vacation with her family for a wedding, so when she got back after almost 2 weeks we had some fun.<n>i collapsed on the ground naked and held my funny bits cringing on the floor as my lady had the longest laugh of her life.
 i haven't found my limits for alcohol yet. keep in mind, i haven't found my limits for alcohol yet.<n>i realize that i am sick of beer, so i go get a couple of shots.(i say a couple because i have no idea how many i actually took)<n>the next thing i remember, i'm awake on the couch in the party host's house, feeling like complete shit.<n>the only thought running through my head is that someone threw up all over me, because somehow, the puke was only on the back side of my pants.
 i always carry my gun with me in my car and then bring it inside when i get home from work or wherever.<n>this morning i was in a rush and was operating on 4 hours sleep. so i had my hands full and just threw my gun on the passenger seat when i got in, next to my computer back pack.<n>didn't want to scare the lady at the window so i threw it in my bag real fast.<n>then i drive 30 min to work and forget it's there and don't put it in the usual spot in the car.<n>get home and reach back to grab the
 Creepy crawlies are something that i just have to deal with sometimes.. except house centipedes. seriously.. fuck those guys.<n> anyway, i was in the shower minding my own business, having a shower beer and thinking about life, when i looked down and there was this **massive** centipede in the tub losing it's mind. it ran over my foot, which made me try to jump out of the way and get it off.<n>Instead, i tried to stop my beer from spilling, which meant i had nothing to grab when i slipped on the obviously slippery tub, and
 i recently got out of a long relationship and have been avoiding going out and getting drunk .<n>my best friend asks if i'm up to much that night, so i invite him along, he's a friend from home so i told him he could crash at mine on my sofa. so at this party i start getting along with this girl and she seems cool and it's obvious where it's leading .<n> fast forward to the end of the night and i've slept with the girl, now as i'm sobering up i'm realising several things, 1-i was and am still not
 i got a rejection letter while at work from an outstanding graduate school in my hometown that i would have loved to go to.<n>during my upset (pretty much crying) state i told one of my apparently loudmouth and untrustworthy coworkers what had happened, in confidence.<n>Turns out that my boss has major hookups at that school, and he was going to speak to the dean about rescinding the letter. now that the whole office is about to know that i got rejected, he can't work his magic because if he does everyone will know about the kind of pull that he has at the school.
 i haven't been sleeping well this week, which means my caffeine input is higher than normal.<n> realizing the murder scene likely waiting beneath my pale thighs, i opted for a courtesy flush.<n>the back of my neck breaks out in what i assume to be a cold sweat.<n>unfortunately for my story, springing into action is less dramatic than expected and consists solely of removing the tank's lid.
 This happened about a month ago, but it took me some time to get over the shame .<n>i was so smart to do so, the shit hadn't dried, and i could clean it with toilet paper and a shower .<n> moral of the story: don't go to sleep when you have the urge to shit .
 i dropped my ipod and the screen shattered, so i decided to take off the screen for whatever stupid reason i had in mind. now half the touch screen is unresponsive, making the ipod useless.<n>i let my 17 month old brother play with my psvita, which lead to him somehow factory resetting that.<n>i downloaded something to finish the survey, hoping i could just delete it afterwards. it made chrome always open up to some \do search\ page.<n>i decided to update my computer to windows 8.1, and after installing it i now have 1 inch black borders around my screen.
 i have the player on my personal laptop, but had forgotten that downloading it opens the flood gates for porn and related pop ups.<n>i say the word \ship\, and i'll be damned, as soon as the words left my mouth and the students lunged for the screen..a pop up of an chinese girl in lace lingerie appeared, face down ass up.<n>the students ended up hands on the ass!
 i have never experienced a more satisfying shit than today.<n>it exploded out of my rectum in a blaze of tear inducing, stinky glory, and i sighed in relief.<n>after my poop, i meekly performed the waddle of shame back to my class. surprisingly, no one gave me a second glance.
 i ordered a medium pizza and some breadsticks from papa johns .<n>i ate 3 slices and 3 breadsticks and put the rest in the fidge .<n>i think to myself, \maybe he just put it all in one box\
 i used adobe premier pro and the editing was impossible and i have an old machine (the render took bloody hours - it finished right before we had to present the video)<n>well, it turns out one minute of the finished film was zoomed in of the ten (hundreds of clips i sorted last night were perfectly fine, just two of them were not)<n>and it just happened to be zoomed in on my friend's ample and shapely breasts.
 since the semester started, i noticed that the same guy, whom i shall refer to as \the brony\, is often sitting at my computer right before the class .<n>every time i see him at my computer he's sitting there with his thinning, greasy, stringy, untrimmed hair which just sort of hangs over his sweaty forehead .<n>he also seems to wear the same clothes many days in a row .<n>our class meets three times a week and a few weeks i've seen him in the same nasty sweatshirt and sweatpants combo (which begins to accumulate food particles and other debris) all
 i was jogging with the owner son of a small family owned pizza restaurant .<n>We decided to go for a jog in the park the next morning .<n>We start our 1.2mile journey around the park and everything seems fine until we get back to where our cars are parked .<n>We finally get back to our cars and he immediately starts yammering on about some bull crap small talk .<n>i swing my hand into his and as soon as the two touch i completely let loose.<n>i rained down a liquid storm of crap. all down my legs and of course i'm wearing white track pants!
 This wasn't today, it was 1 year ago but i saw the same thing again which reminded me of the incident .<n>i was working as an intern in it last summer. there was this red cart we had that made tons of noise. now this is a big red cart where it's usually laden down with about 75+ pounds of crap.
 I was a virgin at the time so i spent time thinking about how i was going to approach the situation .<n>I haven't seen my gf since that day but i still text her .
 i have the galaxy s3 and the apple earpods.<n>i put my earphones in to listen to a podcast the other day as i journeyed to work, and for some reason, the sound wouldn't come out of the right ear.<n> eventually, this pissed me off to the point where i broke off the right earphone.
 friends and i rented a cabin earlier this summer with a 3rd floor balcony. night time. decide to try to piss off of the balcony into the fire pit below.<n>i underestimated my distance and pissed on the dog instead.<n>friend bought the dog inside and went to bed. dog slept with him, covered in my piss.<n> came into the kitchen the next morning complaining that the dog must have rolled in something and smelled awful.
 in a dream, i slowly slide my hand up her naked thigh. the second i reach her privates, all the muscles in my body release in a wonderful spasm of ecstasy.<n>with a sinking stomach, i realize instantly what is happening; my dick is happily pumping cum into my underwear like it's waving freely in an open field.<n> pulling my cheeks apart has never been more painful - both physically and emotionally.
 i set up my mom on dropbox so that she could have access to her photos across all her devices.<n>She would have her photos backed up to an external source along with her computer and external hard drive and i wouldn't have to back up the photos every single time she wanted things backed up.<n>i got distracted and forgot to switch it over. now over the course of about four months her photos have slowly been backing up on my dropbox without me knowing.
 i was wondering, \man, i bet i could shove something up my ass,\ so i started looking around for something to use as a makeshift dildo ('dem hormones)<n>all i found was a razor, but it had a handle so, hey, it worked!<n>after successfully applying lube shampoo, i grabbed it, and, quite frankly, wanted to see how far it could go.<n> somewhere in this mess, my hand got sliced by the razor.
 i need something to pick me up. coffee. but i don't like coffee, except for ice mochas.<n>i have ice, a blender, coffee, sugar, i think this will work.<n>i get out the big bag of ice and i plop some cubes in. then i knock the measuring cup over with the wand still in it.<n>dark, grainy liquid coats my countertop, but i manage to save some.<n>did i mention we have ants right now? well, they're crawling all over me as i'm trying to make the chocolatey, sugary substance disappear.
 i attend college and am part of a fraternity. since it's the weekend, me and a few of my buddies decided to go to another frat house and have a beer or 10 and party. eventually, as the night progresses and so does our lack of sobriety, we decide to leave and head back to our own house.<n>As we are going to a door that leads us out, we try to open it and it gets (what we thought) stuck...it would open an inch or so and just wouldn't open any further.<n>Not thinking to just go out another way 10 feet down the hall,
 her dad went into her room to get a towel because he was taking a shower,my cum towel,all over him.<n>well, this morning around 2 am we fucked and after i was finished i asked for a towel,cleaned myself,put the towel back.<n>i get a text from my girlfriend at around 11 am saying she couldn't stop laughing.<n>i asked why,and she told me. her dad went into her room to get a towel because he was taking a shower,my cum towel,all over him.
 i don't like voicemail. it takes too long to go through and i usually know what the subject of a call is, even if they don't text me right after, so i hadn't checked for a week.<n>i get a call at 2 am from an 808 area code, which i don't recognize so i let it go to voicemail, which i then check.<n>there were 3 messages: 1 from my grandma who lives in Hawaii (area code 808), 1 from my mom, and 1 from an hr person at my city hall where i had applied for a job which was in my
 my husband says he just sat down to do his nightly ritual and that it may be awhile as the heat was affecting him too. cue drastic measures.<n>i attempted to busy my mind with making the bed and just walking around. guess what? it didn't work!<n>as soon as my pants came down the molten hot lava erupted from my anus with the loudest most obnoxious sounds following with it.
 for a really long time now i have had this cyst. nothing particularly special about this cyst.<n>i popped a small erection. cool? cool. actually: horrible. the cyst was on my penis.<n>i just popped two stitches, on my penis, opening a very fresh crater about the size of a hole punch in a piece of paper on my penis because i couldn't get my mind off sex.
 intern tries to use the restroom on the 23rd floor of an office building .<n>door to the stall is locked .<n>i shuffle my way down 23 flights of stairs to the lobby, and ride the elevator back to my floor .<n>feeling both defeated and full to the bursting point, i made my way into the stall, where, upon sitting down on the toilet, my leg began to cramp violently from all the stairs .
 i have dreamed of this day and it was ruined. not only was i not able to pose it caught me running/skipping/walking.<n>anyone know how long it usually takes to update?
 i was talking to an internet friend and said something extremely negative that really freaked him out .<n>i came back 30 minutes later to about 20 messages from him and a friend i know in real life asking if i was okay, telling me not to do it .<n>turns out my internet friend took it that i'm about to kill myself, and sent my irl friend a few frantic messages describing the situation .<n>i couldn't convince him i was okay. he drove to my house and we had a long conversation, mostly of me convinving him that i am indeed not about to commit suicide
 i refilled my lighter every few days with zippo brand fluid, and had finished the container 4 days before .<n>i didn't hesitate to buy said fuel as soon as i heard the price was a third of the price of proper zippo fuel .<n>i decided, \fuck it\, lit a lucky strike and was blown away by the disgusting taste in my mouth .
 An old jar of hotdog relish hadn't been used in about 9 months.<n>About 10 seconds into the activity my member started to feel a bit hot, and about 15 seconds in i was running to the cold tap because it felt like my cock had been stung by a swarm of angry Japanese wasps.
 i outgrew my \that guy\ stage years ago, and now i get to silently cringe in class when someone else is being \that guy\ and running their stupid goddamn mouth about some shit they don't even understand .<n>i don't know who you are, back row crocodile dundee hat guy, but you seem to be a douche and i can feel the palpable cringe settle on the room when you talk .<n>why can't i just keep my mouth shut? it's one thing to participate in class discussions, it's another to be an obnoxious know-it-all .
 last night, i ate about half a bag of spicy nacho doritos and about 10 hot wings leftover from lunch.<n>my stomach had a bit of the gurgles all morning.<n>the fart comes on and i roll the windows down in preparation. then it hits me.<n>my scumbag rectum had soaked my boxers but left no trace on my pants.
 two weeks before the actual story i got very very sick.<n>after cleaning up and zipping up my pants the cramps came again, this time only worse.<n> imagine someone reaching into your gut and just twisting the hell out of your stomach and intestines.<n>my teenage son found me laying there, curled up in the fetal position, on the bathroom floor.
 i've been dating this guy for about six months .<n>things are going great so he finally asks me to have dinner with his family .<n>when i plopped my ass down on the toilet, i neglected to put the toilet lid up .<n>i was sitting on top of the toilet lid in a puddle of my piss, on top of hand towels drenched in my piss, and my piss is dripping down the sides of the toilet and pooling up at the base of the toilet .
 as usual i was on tifu, reading \tifu by not letting the dog out.\ as i was reading, my teacher said \that is a very inappropriate site you are on, leave it now.\<n>in my panic, i hit the back button, and the story in the middle of the screen was \tifu by telling my girlfriend that i got a lap dance at my buddy's bachelor party\
 i had just finished my lunch break and had a large root beer with it.<n>one of the first cars is smaller and has parked further away than they should from the window, so i have to lean on the ledge and stretch to reach them.<n>i pressed my stomach up to the ledge to reach out the window to get her money.<n>Immediately following that sound was an unexpected, wet belch.<n>she glares and calls me a fucking disgusting pig, then speeds off.
 last night i was out with friends, and we all had off the next day(today)<n>So we decided to drive to m's house and get plastered then have the dd take us to get chinese food.<n>i guess at one point during the night my manager asked me to sub for one of my coworkers on... you guessed it, today!!<n> and drunk me thought \hey i need the money, go for it\ but when i woke up today at 4 am to open the pool at a little place called [home] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs9oo
 My brother is in town from graduate school, his dog (modello) has been staying at my house until he finally moves for his new job.<n>modello is the same way for the most part, but he has a problem of getting into the garbage when people are gone.<n>when i come home and notice he's rummaged through my bin, i flip shit, and he cowers because he knows he's done something wrong.<n>i come home after 6 hours of being away and modello rushes up to me, starts jumping up and i'm like \no. you don't give me
 when we saw a hot dog stand we went right the fuck ahead and picked up a few. now, these being pretty long (6 1/2 or 7 inches), my considerably stupid friend dared me to try and eat one of these things in one bite.<n>i, being just as or even more of a dumbshit, agreed and went ahead. bad choice.<n>it appeared that i had horridly underestimated the amount of slopping wet mash that a single hot dog can produce. it crowded up my whole mouth, stretching into the rear of my mouth and aggrieving my gag reflex to the point where i had no
 i make 5 debt payments a month, it used to be 6, but i cleared it a couple of months ago .<n>my mom has helped me with one and off every two months or so since she knows i'm struggling with money .<n>i don't know how i'm going to be able to pay this off, i have a couple of payments coming up and rent and i'm freaking out .
 after a night of partying we were all really (very) drunk, and were all making our way towards bed.<n>hearing that my roommate is hooking up with one of the girls we were partying with.<n>as drunk as i was i figured it was no big deal and i would just pass out in my bed (only like 5 feet away) and let them do their thing.<n>i'm climbing into bed and i realize that my roommates little sister (who was partying with us too) is already there, but again due to the fact that i am drunk as shit i think nothing of it and just climb in too
 as i was running down one road to get off base, there's another path that makes it impossible to see other people walking .<n>i had no shame to sing along to one of my favorite songs by the lonely island, \dick in a box\<n>as i'm running down this road, it's the beginning of my run and i still had a lot of stamina, so i had all of my breath with me and wasn't panting .
 i forgot to shave and ended up with 3 flaps of skin on my thumb .<n>i still shudder from having my left thumb near my razor .<n> also i regret not taking a picture, it would have been a great post for r/wtf.
 i'm usually shy when it comes to flirting, but after a few drinks things were working pretty well .<n>he was holding a blue drink, he said it was something mixed with vodka and they were serving double doses .<n>every sip was like drinking toothpaste solved in vodka, the mint flavor was too much making it disgusting, but my throat was dry after the joint .<n>i never thought how fast my reflexes were until i turn my back on the girl and start running to the bathroom which was on the other side of the building .
 i won a twitter competition to meet the band and bring a friend free of charge. turns out...i won.<n>unfortunately i didn't check my emails in the hours before the show and missed out.
 i stop and try to keep my ass floating and keep the most serious poker-face of my life.<n> ended up waiting for an hour and then subtely throw away my boxers stained with a gross shade of green.
 i went to taco bell and ordered somedoritos locos tacos.<n>i brought them home and sucked 2 of the tacos down into my black hole of a stomach.<n>i was about a 3rd of the way through the final one, when my fingers inexplicibely ceased to function and released my orange dusted treasure to the dirty floor.
 i was doing a bit of coding while my girlfriend was playing a game, and i randomly got up to stretch while watching archer.<n>my girlfriend got up at the same time, and we decided to give each other a hug (aw)<n>i said something about working too hard on my project, and she replied with \i'll show you working too hard\ and pulled me to the bed. we start making out and are just getting into it (archer is on in the background to mask sound).<n> suddenly, archer says to krieger \aaaaand that erection is really inappropriate\, right as my girlfriend
 our youngest son is a legendary pants pooper in our family .<n>He crapped his pants at home, in line at the grocery store, at the movie theater, at the park... i'm sure you get the picture.<n>i imagine that some poor, unsuspecting burger king employee probably smelled the tear inducing stink of a destroyed pair of fruit of the looms rolled up in a paper bag and tossed in the trash receptacle by the sink.
 i've never been eye raped so intensely by a mother while she is shepherding her young son .<n>i've never been eye raped so intensely by a mother while she is shepherding her young son .<n>i've never been eye raped so intensely by a mother while she is shepherding her young son .
 she took two tests and she's not pregnant.<n>i had a trusted friend with her while she took the tests because i was worried she'd lie about it.<n>the sex we had was protected by the way.
 The last year of cooking flashed before me, even concoctions that the pan never saw .<n>i begged that they never wash it and stick it in the oven if they don't want to see it .<n>the road to hell is paved with good intentions and i finally understood .
 i woke up this morning without any blankets on and the sheet torn off my bed.<n>i felt this crusty substance on my face.<n>i was confused and went to rub it off when i saw my hands and they were covered in dried blood.<n>i noticed my left, big toe was in a lot of pain and bruised, and i struggled walking.<n>i get to the mirror in the bathroom and there is blood all over my face and a giant gash in between both of my eyebrows.
 i was in charge of creating their user accounts for our platform and then manually send the login details to each user.<n>two hours later and away from the office i realise i sent some users the wrong information.<n> hurriedly i tried to fix the problem with only my phone at hand.
 This happened about a month ago, but it feels like it happened just yesterday .<n>By now i've drunk a ton of blood that it makes me puke- twice. again, on the floor, not in the toilet.<n>this whole ordeal was tiring, and with the addition of being very drunk i decide to just lay down in the bathroom for a second or two .<n>i do remember waking up and staring at puke right in front of my face and mutter \fuck, i did it again\
 i shoved it in, slowly, but deeper each time, and i had done this before, infact, alot .<n>i then spend 25 mins trying to pull it out... but [it was no use!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmuvfw0vly4)
 My girlfriend and I were two of the most trusted and well-respected students in our high school .<n>One day we sneaked into a classroom to retrieve a book we forgot about .<n>We played it off as if we were looking for a specific book for our tutoring class.<n>The teacher didn't bat an eye and continued to look for some staples while my gf and i split as soon as we could, counting our blessings.<n>We then asked another teacher for her keys under the pretense of returning a book we forgot about.<n>The nice teacher hands us the keys. we then proceed back into the
 \kutabare!\ \kuso kurae!\ we're both white and she calls me a baka gaijin. she didn't even pronounce it right!<n>i got a penalty because they didn't believe it was an accident.<n>the kicked weeaboo girl also got benched with an ice pack for a while and stared daggers (or katanas?) at me the whole time.
 last night i had a glass of wine and watched tv before bed. seems like a nice way to end a day, and surely the next would be better, right? not quite.<n> today i got out of work an hour or so earlier than usual and decided to do some dishes, but had forgotten to grab the wine glass on the dresser the television's on.<n> apparently from the ear-destructing noise and high volume, the dresser had vibrated just enough to move the wine glass teetering over the edge and shatter on the floor. now the mini bar has one empty spot and it won't stop mocking me
 my girlfriend, now to be referred to as gf, is out of town for a few weeks. she is not the forgiving type.<n>We have a mutual friend, the gf's best friend actually. her and her boyfriend of 2 years or so just broke up.<n>She comes over a few days after the break up to take her mind off of it. as the night progresses we end up sleeping together.
 This is my first post, english is my 2nd language so i might mess up and i made a throwaway for this. be kind, please correct any mistakes or loopholes and such (i'm bad with logic) and there's a tl:dr at the end.<n>i just got my first *real* boyfriend a little over a week ago- the relationship itself started a little tifuesque (* at the bottom for anyone who cares about that) but i'm pretty happy with him and was excited all week .<n>i didn't want to share this story with anyone at first but now i
 My father, aunt, and i decided to go for a boat ride to a local oceanside restaurant .<n>It's one of those restaurants where you tie your boat up to a mooring, and a launch boat picks you up and takes you to the restaurant .<n>As we get onto the pier, i look at the boats and say to my father \hey, didn't we anchor the boat over there?\ the boat didn't seem to be moving, so we assumed everything was fine .
 i tore my frenulum. we clean it up and try to figure out what to do because everytime i stand up i feel like i'm going to pass out.<n>i eventually gather the strength to get up and walk home from where we were (don't ask) without passing out.
 every night i take gentle laxatives, but two nights ago i may have forgotten to take it.<n> this morning i awake eat some breakfast and felt \the beast\<n>it was a toughie, but with some aggressive force it began to move out.<n>it felt like i was passing out a fist sized clump of pointy stones and dry twigs.
 i'm a bit of a addict to jogging.<n>Before every run i try to hit the bathroom and get everything out so i don't need to run back home to go take a shit in the middle of my run.<n>it can be a long way to the get home to if you really need to go you know... stomach felt good.<n>i have taken two showers since the accident and even though i'm clean now i plan on taking at least one more before going to work.
 i'm the kind of pansy man who prefers baths over showers .<n>my knee stings for like 15 - 30 minutes. not a fun day .
 i was on a school trip to dc, it was my first time going there so i was pumped.<n>we went to see all of the main touristy attractions (this is day one) then lastly we go on this big yacht.<n>i haven't slept for maybe 48 hours, as i can't sleep in vehicles and it is about an 8 hour ride down.<n>my glasses decide to slide off my face. *shit what do i do now?* i text my mom to tell her my new glasses just fell through the propeller of a huge boat and are now chilling in the potomac.
 when i'm doing the deed my dick starts to feel minty and i see some of the conditioner slip into the cum canal .<n>i thought nothing of this and when i tried to pee afterwards i felt the force of and entire spice cabinet exploding in my urethra .
 i let rip a monstrous fart, and before i know it a terrible smell wafts up to my nose .<n>my shower handle and below it are almost completely coated brown .<n>i tried to wash it away by using a few different kinds of soaps and shampoos, but alas, the smell lingers .
 I've been hanging out with this girl for 2 years .<n>We do everything fingering,hand of skirt, bj, except sexual intercourse .<n>She told me she's not ready for a relationship even though we do everything a couple does .
 i wanted to see if i could clear the height of my counter in my house with a jump and ended up cracking my back midair. now i'm sitting here in a decent amount of pain and hoping it passes.
 after work, i started flipping it around, because my walk is a mile and a 1/2, very boring.<n>a cop drives by slowly, cuts me off and gets out of his car.<n>He asks if i have a knife, i say, \i do, but the blade is flat, nonexistent even. may i ask why you stopped me?\ he goes on about how someone called the cops saying someone was walking with a knife, flipping it around and such. i say ok, and he then asks to see it, it has a latch that keeps it locked close, so i undo that and hand him it.
 i have to be up early tomorrow for some volunteering shit with my girlfriend.<n>i intended take an title tomorrow morning because i also haveresearch to do afterwards.<n>i went to take a unisom sleeping tablet. first i went to grab aderall to bring with me to bring with me my girlfriends so i wouldn't forget it.<n>signals got crossed and i took the had about 15 minutes later, i realize my mistake.
 i recently purchased a used $100.0 16 foot trampoline off of craigs list with my best friend.<n>in the next second i jumped with the highest bounce i could manage and when i reached the peek of my jump i knew it was my cue to act.<n>However, that is when faltered and locked my leg onto the trampoline the pain i next endured was the most excruciating experience since i ran full force into a cactus.
 i've been trying to get them together for a few weeks now but she just isn't warming up to him so i meet up with her in person.<n>We decided to rendez-vous at the graveyard. we sit down on the edge of a grave because there's nowhere else to sit.<n>i'm trying to persuade her into getting with my friend when she tells me to close my eyes.<n>i comply and badda bing baddo boom we're making out on somebody's grave. so the grave is covered by one large flag-stone. she pushes me back onto it in
 i accidentally forgot to change the length on the shaver, and i ended up giving him a number 1 haircut (a 0 will make you bald)<n>my uncle had cancer around 3 years ago and he's still traumatized from the cancer, hospital and all the things they had to do to in order to get rid of the cancer. he now looks like he has cancer again thanks to me.
 \i am in class today, but i was a few minutes late and missed the sign in sheet\<n>\i accidentally sent it from my undergraduate email account\
 i woke up late, spent too much time at a tent sale and had to get in to study for the mcat. the time was about 1 pm, so i'd lost the chance to study this morning.<n>i drove from the tent sale to my parents' house to show off the wetsuit i just bought and grab a quick bite to eat.<n>i toss the thai sauce on one side of the bun, the chicken on top of it, the glaze on the chicken, and the bun on top.<n>i stop eating and quickly spit out the mouthful of stale bread, chicken and red sauces to find an inch
 i somehow ended up in his pictures folder .<n>they were pictures taken of my dad and his girlfriend, from his pov, many shots of which include her face .<n>my dad's girlfriend gets suddenly enraged and tells my dad, \obviously she can't use your phone anymore\
 so i woke up a little earlier than usual, i decided to get an early start to my morning (read: my subreddits haven't had much activity in the 5 hours since i fell asleep browsing r/wtf)<n>i decided am going to use the few extra minutes to pass the shop vac over the carpet in the spare bedroom/home gym/dressing room/animal housing room, to clean up after my 6 [degus](http://i.imgur.com/jyt0hf8.jpg) (say hi to dactyl!! very cute, but very messy little rascals they are!)
 after a long time of searching for gushers i had no luck so i decide to ask an employee.<n>there were many out there but i went to this girl in particular. super hot, my height too and that's rare, bro.<n>On the way i decide to drink the soda i had in my hand to freshen up my mouth, which was stupid to begin with.<n>All of the soda comes spilling out on to my shirt and her shoes as well.
 when i was in high school, i was in a competitive sports and games class .<n>One day, we were playing indoor hockey in the gym. like usually, it was an pretty intense match.<n>i remember a player on the opposing team hit the puck towards my team's goal. focusing completely on intercepting the puck before an opposing player received it, i am startled when i look up and notice another player standing directly in my path.<n>i attempted to stop before i ran into her,but it was too late.<n>the collision itself didn't seem so bad, but when she hit the floor,
 i threw one in my mouth and slowly chewed. thinking it wasn't hot at all i swallowed.<n>it was like 1000 shots of satan's cum.<n>i couldn't breath and had to suck down a whole cup of water before i could continue.<n>it got worse and worse with every bite.<n>what's worse is that i have bad asthma and with every bite i had to take a hit from my inhaler.
 i was getting ready to bike to the gym and walked to my car in the driveway to get my headphones.<n>my chiweenie donny must have snuck out behind me while i was rummaging through the car.<n>he came hobbling back, leaning on one side and keeled over onto the grass, which is usually how he \submits\ after you play with him and wants his belly rubbed.<n>i noticed he had numerous cuts, a gash under his eye. he was also panting (which he never does) and one of his eyes was looking slightly in the wrong direction.
 ze has wanted one for a while...so i found one at a reasonable price and purchased it. it's quite large, 100 lb heavy bag.<n>ze bruised and bloodied hir knuckles all to hell. it still hurt pretty bad a couple days later...so ze went to the doc to get checked out. turns out ze broke a couple bones.
 My girlfriend's grandmother died three days before the prom .<n>My girlfriend refused to go to the prom because it was her boyfriend's prom .<n>\i definitely want to be the good boyfriend. i'm gonna sit there with her through this!\<n>i'm thinking maybe she's mad at me for taking her up on my offer for me to leave her, but she doesn't seem mad, just sad. so, i go back to assuming it's her grandmother.
 at the time i was into some weird naruto hentai and wasnt smart enought to clear my history... so my mom was sending out emails to the clients when 2 of them promptly stopped emailing us back.<n>Mom decides to look at her sent mail to see if she had said anything wrong and started scrolling through her email and then she found 50 extremely explicit images of the shame of my nightmares.<n>i got a talking to the next day by my dad asking if it was me. i of course said it was just the virus being gross.<n>the next day my mom told one of my friends who knew what i
 my talented girlfriend made a delicious meal of fresh carved turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, and all that other good stuff .<n>the next night i come home from work and make myself a plate and soak everything in gravy, because i fucking love gravy, especially her homemade gravy .<n>i don't like mashed potatoes without gravy, and i normally love anything my girlfriend makes.<n>i don't understand how her gravy turned out this way. she's like a thinner, sexier paula deen when it comes to cooking .
 i have been thinking up amazing april fool's jokes to play on my little brother, who gets me with amazing pranks every year.<n>i finally thought of the best prank after watching a video one of my friends made last April fools day.<n>i would rubberband the sprayer on my sink, and watch the hilarity that would ensue when my brother tries to wash a dish or his hands.
 A girl was trying to walk in a straight line while simultaneously staring at the scary high schoolers .<n> hilarity ensued. the girl fell right over on her face .<n>i'd say you had to have been there, but i swore in that moment it sounded just like a giant 50-pound pancake belly-flopping into a pool of pure liquefied giggles .
 \i usually am pretty quick-minded with situations.\<n>\you think they are going to believe me because i'm black and you're white?\<n>\the ball is in my court! the officer immediately arrested the kid and read him his rights!\
 i heard \you bitch!\ as he cupped himself and tried to zip up properly. didn't get caught.<n>i later made up for it with a proper blowup.
 i found 4 boxes of oreos so i grabbed a handful. there was a tv in the kitchen and there was a cat so i was more than distracted in my high state.<n>i looked down to see that i had gone through two whole boxes (you know the kind with 3 rows and a flap)<n>my stomach screamed like a thousand wounded kittens and i sharted.<n>i threw down my pants and projectile shat everywhere. the bush was smothered in my fecal orgasm.<n>the smell was so unbearably grotesque that i don't even have a good analogy for it.
 i was working on a water sourced a/c unit last week and had to run new pipe to the unit. after running the new i left and let the glue cure until my co-worker could get back to run the unit a couple days later. he ran the unit and everything was fine, so he finished up for the day and left the a/c running.<n>my boss calls me this morning and tells me i need to get over there now, the owner called and said the place was flooded.<n>i went there as quick as i could and there is about a foot of water in 2 seperate rooms, both
 The next morning i was late to my class so i brought my toothbrush and brushed my teeth on the way.i threw up as soon as i realised it .<n>there i was shit in my mouth puke on my clothes in the doorway of my 150 student class .
 i had sent my gf a couple of sex toys while she was home for the summer .<n>well she was really happy to see the toys, started charging the batteries i sent, and i'm trying to get her to get frisky on cam with me .<n>Her mother busts into my gf's bedroom and sees me in all my glory and my gf topless on the bed, and proceeds to flip the fuck out .

 i left for home straight from the lab since it's only an hour and a half drive, and traffic wouldn't be bad.<n> halfway home, my hands and feet start getting numb and my stomach starts feeling weird.<n>then i remembered that i hadn't eaten a real meal since 3.<n>i start getting nauseous, but by then, i was only half an hour away from home and was about to get on a bridge.<n>once i got on the bridge, i felt increasingly sick.<n>i couldn't pull to the side without risking getting hit, but the waves of barf in my stomach
 i was academically dismissed from college and have pretty much been a fuck up mt entire life.<n> tonight i had a couple of friends over and my one friend brought a hookah pipe, so i said to him i don't care if you smoke it just don't do it in the house.<n>So i go up stairs (we were in my basement) to put away some stuff and i come back down and there's a bunch of the hookah molasses on a paper towel on the floor .<n>while we are cleaning it up my mom comes downstairs and gets pissy about it. after they leave my
 i love my 3ds xl, i carry it with me everywhere so naturally i put it in the seat-pocket in front of me. and that's where it might still be.<n>i'm a little preoccupied at the moment with my grandfather's impending death my grandmother's complicated and emotionally-laden will, and missing the job that i love for three days of family stress.
 i live in a house with my brother, mom, and her boyfriend.<n>we keep her in the kitchen because she isn't house trained and she loves to get into trouble when she manages to get out of the kitchen.<n>this morning i decided to go on a run, and i put the dog in the kitchen and closed the gate, little did i know that i had left it open slightly.<n>i come back from my run about 30 minutes later, and look in the kitchen to see the gate open and no dog.<n>not only did she eat the garbage in my bathroom, used feminine products spread all over
 i was driving home from raleigh (about a 57 mile drive) at around 1 in the morning, not feeling tired but having hung out with some of my friends and having had tons of fun.<n>when i started feeling drowsy, it's okay i got this, i was only 3 miles from my house, i thought i could manage it.<n>i somehow managed to fall asleep without knowing it and manage to hit 2 trees and an old barn, while falling into an 8 foot deep gulley.
 after a few minutes things start getting hot and heavy and he ends up giving me one of the greatest orgasms in my life .<n>i turn around to see a couple brown smudges glaring up at me from our black sheets .
 i was making jambalaya for dinner and things were going well until i realized that the spice factor needed to be kicked up another notch .<n>while browning some italian sausage i decided to toss some dried red chilies in while the meat was cooking .<n>being that bachelor that i am and not wanting to dirty more dishes, decided it was best to just tear them up and toss them in no harm done .
 My brother asked me if i can take him to Walmart so he can buy the new album .<n>I didn't realize that the album had to say explicit on it for it to be the \normal version\<n>We get home and about 20 minutes later he says \this is the clean version\ in a sad and dissapointed tone.
 this has to be the most awkward experience i have experienced in a long time .<n>i accidentally grabbed a handful of a girl's left tit .
 My brother and I are trying for green cards/permanent residencies only my brother didn't come to the us on time so the day earlier, he gets kicked off the flight and is stuck in our home country .<n>We look similar and our names are the same except for my middle name which is customary .<n>One week later after my brother got into this trouble, two guys in suits come up to my cubicle, and ask me my full name - i say yeah, that's me but i go by \middle name\
 my economics teacher was standing right behind me, giving me the 'what the fuck is this guy doing?' look.<n> needless to say, he walked right out of there, probably dis-acknowledging my existence for the rest of the day.
 every day when i leave i go to my locker, take off my toolbelt and work shirt and go home, pretty much in that order .<n>well today for some reason, i decided to take off my work shirt before reaching my locker.<n>i proceed to take off my regular shirt and am standing there in my bra for a good three and a half seconds before i felt a breeze and realized what i had done.
 today i said i would do well. only had i not forgotten that something has always got to give. anyway.<n>so i'm in calculus, getting ready to start a quiz when prof asks if anyone has any questions, and i remember that i don't quite remember how to do something.<n>i promptly raise my hand and begin to try to explain what concept it is exactly that i am not grasping. word vomit at it's best.<n>i get all ashamed and shit, and interrupt her with \oh, i get it now.\ she shoots me a look that could make jackie chan shit his
 i\u2019m washed and pretty drunk so i fall asleep within minutes of take off.<n>the guy sitting next to me is on his laptop\u2014looks like a music program, fl studio or something\u2014and even though his screen is tilted down, it\u2019s on full bright.<n>i put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there\u2019s no chance.<n>my back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but i\u2019m wide awake, and getting mad.<n>the attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us
 i was just enjoying my post-dinner poop sesh in the upstairs bathroom in my parent's house, where i recently moved back into.<n>Now, they use sandpaper-roughness level tp, always have.<n>i, being a young man full of hopes and dreams of silken rolls for my cheeks, have been buying very nice, soft tissues for myself while i was out of the house.
 i've been to the east coast of the north island (nz) a few times.<n>the spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place.<n>the morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as i get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now.<n>i dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.<n>brain hemorrhage. ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later i still can't attend school 5 days a week because i get too tired.
 i was visiting my parents over the weekend with my sister's boyfriend who'd never shot a rifle before .<n>we went down to the area where i typically shoot which is a slight hill looking down into an area with a thick dirt berm .<n>the next day i leave my parents house at about 10 pm to head back home, about 3 hours into my drive i get a call from my father who sounds incredibly serious .<n>he tells me that the sheriff came by and that apparently when i was out shooting the day before 3 rounds had hit their neighbors mobile home penetrating the exterior wall and fucking up
 as my dad was taking a corner this tent fell out of the back of our pickup truck and my dad flipped a bitch.<n>in my brilliance i shouted, \hey! fuck you!!\ instead of \that's ours!\ or not even saying anything at all.<n>my dad got out of the truck and defused the situation, then ate my soul by yelling at me for being a dumbass.
 i was going on a morning run when i hit a tree root and land on brambles .<n>The brambles went right up my shorts and... yep, cut me.<n>i didn't take much notice of the pain until now (i had also cut my inner thigh so i focused on that more)<n>i am not totally sure this is what happened but it looks like this is the cause.
 i'm currently using a washer that is not mine, and in another house. no one lives there; it's a weird circumstance.<n>i get to the bottom of the washer and see that there are 2 nails jammed into the holes where the water drains. they won't come out, and one is jammed so far down i can barely see it.<n>i just broke someone else's washer. update: one of my roommates checked it out and managed to remove the nails. it seems to be working again.
 i saw my cat sleeping on the bench in there and he was doing that adorable little thing where the cover their eyes with one paw.<n>i had the sudden urge to cuddle him on the couch so i go over there and pick him up. now, he was resisting me and i should have taken that as a warning but he was going to cuddle with me whether he liked it or not.<n>So i hold him like a toddler and bounce around and pet him for a while and then i sit him down on the couch by his belly... and he lets out this nasty sounding fart.
 \So you don't want any fat people at your school?\<n>\because we don't want any fatty fatsos at our school!\<n>\coincidentally, she coincidentally moved a few weeks later, and to be honest, i don't really know if \coincidentally\ belongs in this sentence\
 Anyway, it's been a long day so far. but, on the bright side, my girlfriend promised we can have sex tonight, so i've got that going for me.<n>i apparently misjudged how small the spots were. as i gingerly backed in, i started feeling good.<n>i did get the job done, but not before i pulled the car out of the spot and managed to bump the side against the pole in my mini-panic.
 i was accepted into college so i decided to have a party like anyone would.<n> smashed a bottle of jack in the space of an hour, topped off a bacardi and coke, and dropped about halfway through whatever i drank next.<n>i waddled over to the kitchen to get some dry biscuits in an attempt to stop myself from emitting viscus death all over the house.<n>i could have collapsed, i could have convulsed, i could have done both and left myself strewn on the cold floor for my roommate to discover my frozen corpse but no.<n>i couldn't help but feel that not attending this
 i'm trapped on the toilet and needed something to pass the time .<n>i bought some panties and stopped at the bathroom again .<n>the whole reason i'm writing this story is because i'm trapped on the toilet and needed something to pass the time .
 i nicked the actual tip of my man nipple... :( please note that this cut looks like a got poked with a needle, yet so much fucking blood came out!
 when i stop at the stop sign at the bottom of my hill i see a chick slumped over against the stop sign pole .<n>after getting my icey cold deliciousness i drive home having a nice time listening to some good tunes when i see her still slumped there .<n>She starts screaming like a mother fucking banshee she beast and launches herself at my car trying to grab/scratch/claw my face off/kill me with dirty fingernails .
 i'm visiting my bro at his place. he's on an end unit. in between his unit and the last unit is this little fire lane. prime place to park if it wasn't a fire lane. there is no guest parking.<n> anyway, bro keeps telling me i can park in the fire lane because no one gives a shit. anyway, bro keeps telling me some other dude's been parked there for days with no issues.<n>a couple hours later, bro goes to the store with his wife to get some monsters, comes back, asks me where i'd parked. proceeds to tell me
 i don't usually have soft drink but in the case of a university musical theory exam i thought i could use something fizzy.<n>i pick up my bottle of coke and give it two quick shakes and immediately open it, not realising what hell i have unleashed.<n>it spews all over me, my phone and the chick sitting in front of me drenching her. she screeches like a wild yeti and here i am holding a now completely empty bottle with ruined exams in a 3 metre radius.<n>i look like a complete jack ass and the professor didn't have any spare exams left so i will have
 i took a twig to the eye and it went right in. i didn't have time to close my eyes so it went right in.<n>i felt it go in under my lower eyelid and come out again :( i powered home and didn't think much of it till i looked in the mirror and saw that a piece of my lens was scratched off.<n>when i woke up this morning my eye is still hurts.
 so this has happened twice already with the same girl. so we get ready for the sexy times, stuff starts going down, we start playing a little handball, start exploring with our mouths, and then it comes time for the big finale and all of the sudden....limp like the bizkit.<n>i just feel like such a huge douche bag because she keeps asking me if it is her, and it's not, because she is sweet, caring, and all around beautiful girl and i completely enjoy spending time with her and i really care for her.
 i put in my access number and password. didn't work.<n>tried my password again. once more i tried, to no avail. next time i tried it told me my account was locked.<n>i locked some randoms account. next time they log in they will get the error message.
 i'd just finished smoking a couple of joints with some mates at the park and was heading back home when i passed gregs.<n>now normally i would've just walked on gone home and had my munchie snacks there, but today i was far too high to process that.<n>i waltzed in to gregs, spent about 40 minutes too long deciding on my pasty, struggled to count out the money, then wandered outside with my snack.<n>i walked about 10 yards down this busy highstreet, took a bite, bent my knees, and shat my pants.
 habaneros are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno.<n>If you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.
 Well i lost mine and i don't feel like missing lunch for not having it so i made a fake one.<n>But my principle is a bitch and decided to test mine and now may send me to the honor council which if i got in trouble would have to be reported to the college i already got into.
 i went downstairs to get coffee, i left the bedroom door open.<n>the dog went in, into the bin and extracted one of the used condoms... he then took the condom into the hall and left it at the top of the stairs.<n>the little brother... hearing i was awake and probably wanting coffee too decides to come downstairs. he steps on the condom, it sticks to his foot and he proceeds to fall down the stairs.
 when i went to put away the laundry for my mother i found out that she was upset at me because i didn't hear the buzzer go off .<n>\you never do anything unless i get mad or unless it's on your damned computer!\<n>\you only sit on your computer and play shitty games and want to be with your friends and you never do anything helpful around the house anymore\<n>\i'm eighteen and i suppose i'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether i made a huge mistake or not\
 i had just cleaned my shower and i watch helplessly as blood splatters from my nose all over the pristine white of the tub and shower walls .<n>blood fills my mouth and throat and i sputter and sneeze three times, coating the walls, ceiling, shampoo bottles and shower curtain with a thick spray of blood and boogers .<n>when i finally had a chance to survey the scene it looked as if someone had dismembered a corpse with a dull fan blade in my bathroom .
 i've been recovering from food poisoning for the past couple of days .<n>i'm an avid rock climber so i haven't really been able to climb recently because of this .<n>i'm getting ready to go and i take my first step on the wall. ....but... something doesn't feel right.<n>i'm about 7 feet off the ground at this point and instead of going to the bathroom just incase i need to poop, i stayed climbing. now probably about 15 feet off the ground, make the 20, make that 30, 35, 40, now about 45 feet in the
 my sister, who moved into the city to go to unjiversity, left me her guitar. she was an advanced student. she never had spare time, and never took up playing guitar, so she gave it to me.<n>i'm glad i didn't smash the guitar over that asshole's head at my school that one day, but that's a story for another time.
 i am a lawyer in training, i don't want to say in which country, but it's a common law jurisdiction.<n>we have a supreme court and generally junior lawyers don't get to prepare documents for the highest court in the land.<n>i was rushed - the partner was not in the office, i couldn't ask anyone for advice at the time and there was a deadline i had to meet.<n>i barely got it in on time - when i got back to the office i looked over the document i had up on the screen and sure enough, that cunty word was on the screen
 My boss has been saying that he'll get health insurance for weeks and weeks .<n>My boss is not currently looking for health insurance .<n>The good news is that my boss wants this vendor to talk to us about personal plans .<n>The bad news is that my boss is not currently looking for health insurance .
 before i get into this i had been taking pictures of my penis the day before to see how it looked in a photo .<n>i take the perfect one but first i upload it on instagram too see if it looks good, it does so straight to facebook.<n>as i go to post the photo what somehow escaped my attention is i posted the nude i took earlier instead.<n>at this time i turned off my phone and waited for the likes to stroll in, i went for a run and as i came back to check my phone i have messages from my friends saying \dude wtf\
 i'm a 3rd year college student, studying computer science .<n>They asked me to implement a simple game in the c++ language .<n>i spent the week before the scheduled exam reading docs, coding things .
 in my high schools jazz band, we have one couple who are pretty open about their relationship.<n>after out performance, we were all hanging out outside eating street vendor food and talking or whatever, while the couple is eating each others faces out.<n>our band director is no where to be seen, so me and two of my friends decide to screw with the couple.<n>to get the couple to stop eating their faces out, we got some pennies and threw them at them, lightly. we had no intentions to hurt them.<n> supposedly, the girl in the couple thought we were calling her a prostitute by throwing pennies at her
 i was going to meet my girlfriend with my friend at some hotel in some community with a large black population and she was late.<n>i start talking to my friend since i am bored and i get bumped by a huge black guy and i tell my friend \that African American just bumped me\ but then he hears it and says that he is a jamaican and the owner and got kicked out.
 destiny released a new dlc today which i've been looking forward to .<n>i've been at work all day, texting the boys in the group chat about how excited we are.<n>i arrive to the train station and hop on the lakeshore east home bound, take out my headphones and throw on some arctic monkeys and get back to the post i was reading on /r/destinythegame.
 My wife and i are selling our house so we decided to jazz the place up with some new artsy stuff.<n>So we go out to eat at moe's (relevant) before we head to target where we found a nice, heavy wrought iron wall thing for a good price - sold!<n>We bolt out of there and head home excited to setup all the new stuffs.<n>well, upon getting home i realize that moe's has caught up with me but it's late and i'm tired and the new, heavy d\u00e9cor piece is supposed to go into the bath room that i was about to
 i'm chilling, listening to music scrolling through reddit on my phone when my cat walks over and starts rubbing itself on my leg. naturally i pet and play with him for a few minutes and i get up to wipe.<n>my cat is turnt from playing with me, and sees something hanging from my waist.<n>it was in slow motion, i saw my cat arc its back and prepare to lunge, then extend his arms out ward and dig his claws into my crouch.<n>i now have a huge cut going down the shaft of my dick and scrapes in the surrounding area.
 i'm a pretty fragile guy, i get injured way too easy, it's ridiculous.<n>i continue on with my pain and hide it from my parents until Sunday when i couldn't take it anymore. they drove me to the hospital where i had to get x-rays and the doctor had to poke around my rectal area to make sure it wasn't awkward or painful.<n>when the x-rays came back, they told me i had fractured my tailbone. now i'm sitting here at home because i can't take my finals at school and won't go back for another 3
 yesterday i rode to work, about 60 miles. on the return trip i rode fast.<n>i ride a klr, so fast is 85-90. feels about the same as 130 on my friends triumph.<n>got to the last stop sign before home, truck comes to a stop on my right at the same time so i yield. except, he doesn't move. except, he starts texting!<n>i continue to wait and get ansier and ansier. finally when he does lumber through the intersection i had to show my displeasure for his slowness.<n>i wheelie the f off the line.
 after going swimming i woke up laying on my towel and they were all gone .<n> turns out those guys wrote \n!gger\ on my back in sunscreen and it burned into me .<n>i had to wear it home and when i finally got through walking four miles there with no shoes my mom whooped my ass for losing my shoes, wallet and keys .
 My best friend has been infatuated with our teacher a long time .<n>He flirts with her, lets her be alone in his classroom with her, nothing sexual, just out of line .<n>i intended to anonymously send him a small email, warning him that he could hurt his career with that relationship .
 i came across a lab set up for a chemistry class involving a super cool looking glassware setup which i had never seen when i took chemistry.<n>without thinking, took a droplet onto my finger.<n>i have no idea what compelled me to eat this droplet, however, i quickly realized it was some sort of acid- maybe lemon juice? it was so strong i had to spit it out, but i quickly realized something was up when my teeth began to feel strange.
 i click a link that takes me to /r/creepy, a sub i haven't really looked at much .<n> apparently there's a small smudge on the screen when you browse that sub .<n>i spent 5 minutes first using the old spit and fingerwipe, then full blown windex and towel to try and clean it .
 my best friend ate (unknowingly) edible marijuana, had a terrible reaction, and got put in the back of an ambulance.<n>i have no idea what this means for our friendship, her health, or my legal status.
 Several weeks ago, i got bit by an ant on the back of the leg the tiny bite started to swell from a prick to about the size of a quarter in a few hours .<n>the next day it was the size of my whole hand, the next day they swelling had grown larger than a sheet of paper, it ran from the back of my knee all the way up to my bottom of my ass, and took up the whole backside of my leg .<n>i tried benadryl capsules, benadryl cream to no avail. finally a friend suggested arnica and within hours the redness subsided
 i woke up sick. not the kind where you get a little sniffle, that's too easy to deal with .<n>i emailed the professor, explaining the situation, apologizing, and asking if accommodations would be at all possible .
 end of tldr** today is \fake injury day\ at my school.<n>part of school pride week, we got to wear fake blood and bandages to school.<n>i, not wanting to miss out on the fun, but also too lazy to put any real effort into my injury costume, wrote \internal bleeding\ on a white shirt with an arrow to my gut.
 this \fun\ story actually happened last year, but around the same time of the year which reminded me of the awful memory.<n>i decided to bike to work and soak up all the good feels that the sun, flowers, and birds were putting out.<n>well on the way home it's still a gloriously sunny day and everyone has a smile on their face. likewise, i'm grinning ear-to-ear with my mouth open singing and just taking it all in.<n>Unfortunately what i actually ended up taking in was a wasp, straight to the inside of my cheek where it got lodged in place-
 i was asked if i wanted to have a ffm m\u00e9nage  trois. me being a guy, i obliged.<n>We found a site with a decent population, nothing like facebook though.<n>i jokingly (at first) said i could help (stupid?) she throws an lol, then tells me she has tried using certain products to vibrate herself to sleep-dom, but tells me it only made it worse.
 my girlfriend and i had a row earlier this week because i declined to show her my browser history .<n>in an attempt to be more open with her and make her feel better i conceded a few days later and let her look at my browser history .<n>i forgot that the day prior i had been looking up \how to tell if your girlfriend has had a sex change\ and \traces of sex changes\
 jubilee day is a fair/thing that happens in my town every year and it's basically a street fair to be honest, regardless i'd never gone with friends without supervision before .<n>i had been given 20 dollars **which mind you is a holy grail to a 13 year old** and everything starts off smoothly.<n>it started at a necklace shop, and she saw a nike shoe necklace and had to have it, here goes 11 bucks. do your math and you'll see that i have 9 dollars left, which isn't much, but i couldn't do math than either given i was overflowing
 2 days ago she called me and asked for a walk. i was like, sure, he'll yeh! she comes over, we begin talking .<n>\ohm, yeah? what's up?\ \it's a bad idea to use the name of your cat as your username\<n>\i'm really sorry (my name) but this is not how i see you. you're really sweet and quite good looking, but all that relationship stuff is not me\
 as we all changed our clothes me and some classmates we're just derping around and teasing eachother with cold water or pushing eachother in the water .<n>as you all know things escalate right... so as the swim lessons started everything was normal .<n>in the middle of the lane suddenly i felt my swimtrousers being pulled off. there was naked in the pool, with a swift move i pull it back up and laugh it off.<n>it was one of those classmates i was derping around with earlier. he was a rather chubby guy with black swimtrousers and black hair.
 this is my second account because this monster of a person knew about the last account from a previous tifu i posted and proceeded to down vote everything i typed on reddit.<n>i was getting anxious and paced my way back after the job was done only to find l on my chair snooping around on my account like the soulless ginger he is.<n>this will probably be my final post from this username, so goodbye from this guy with a beauty spot on his gooch.
 after all my applications were sent off i was stuck waiting patiently for responses, expecting the earliest in about 6 weeks time.<n>so you can understand my shock when i read an e-mail from one of the better schools saying that i've been accepted unconditionally a few hours ago.
 when his happened, i was living with my parents, a couple years ago.<n>we were letting her out to run around the room every day for at least a couple of minutes, and on one of these \walks\, this happened.<n>we were letting her out to run around the room every day for at least a couple of minutes, and on one of these \walks\, this happened.<n>i impulsively bend my leg to be able to reach it with my hand, but before i could do that i heard a loud squeak, and next thing i see is a blurry, bronze shape flying fast
 i woke up at what i thought was just ten at night. feeling anxious, i took an ambien.<n>what i did not know was that it was in fact five in the morning.<n>this was due to lag on a seven year-old phone i had to reactivate after my brand new iphone fell in the toilet.
 i'm an architecture student taking up summer internship at some kind-of-badass construction firm.<n>it's my last internship (we have two internships) and i am working hard to put some good shit on my cv. anyway, here's the story.<n>we classmates always go to the local bar to get some good beer and chill out. this time, i'm just at my first week of internship. so yeah, we had a couple of hours then we really got drunk, so we decided to leave and go home (for a sense of time, it's 12mn when we
 \i threw on a run play!\<n>\you threw on a run play!\<n>\i'm so sorry,\ about 30 times.<n>\i talked to my coach about it and since he knows i want to play guitar and film more, he offered a shot to go back during the fall and actually film the games!\
 A friend of mine, dubbed andrew from now on, has told me that he wants to start dating carol .<n>i've come to really like carol, and andrew was one of the best people i knew .<n>i'm sure they would have dated without me doing that, but life is all about making you feel like you're the one who tied your own noose .
 i am in the middle of study leave whilst i prepare for my exams i have already sat 4 and tomorrow was supposed to be sitting my maths exam.<n>this morning i woke up but decided to stay in bed and relax, my mum was taking my siblings to school so i didn't need to get up for another hour.<n>when i finally decided to get up i made some breakfast when i hear a phone rings.<n>they tell me that i have 15 minutes to get to school otherwise i will not be able to sit my exam.<n>i hang up the phone, race to my room to get changed and start telling
 i particularly hate those giant fucking roaches that are sometimes referred to as water bugs.<n>right before bed i see one of those motherfucking roaches running across my bedroom floor.<n>i stomp at it a couple times before it disappears behind my desk.<n>i grab my sandal and swat at him. he runs down the side of the bed and disappears under it.
 i can't sleep from drinking about 4 energy drinks so i figured i'd post my first \tifu\<n>i woke up at 4am not by choice but because i couldn't go back to sleep so i ended up going to the library .<n>After a total of 10 hrs and 2 rockstars i do what any single 21 year old stressed college student does, and pop up the internet (on my tablet)<n>put on my headphones and raise the volume, keep in mind my parents are home. we all know what i did there so i'll skip that.
 so i'm doing year 11 history and i won a bet with my teacher that if our document analysis (an essay thingy) impressed him first time, we get to watch season 1-3 of erb of history .<n>well, i impressed, mainly cause i'm repeating the unit (by choice, i did it a year early and wanted more practice before doing year 12 history) and remembered how to write these really well.<n>when i told everyone i'd make the bet, they all got really excited and encouraged me, then, when he watched... the class was in utter silence, no laughs,
 My maths teacher is a really funny old guy and loves to make jokes about what we do on the weekend .<n>My friend alexis is a good friend of ours and emits more sexual appeal then chernobyl emits radiation .<n>After a few rounds of a drinking game i find myself in a bedroom alone with alexis .<n>I try my very hardest to contain my laugh, and succeed, but instead what can only be described as the moan of a mating of goat comes out of my mouth .
 about a year ago my younger brother, bought an airsoft gun .<n>i promised him i would. now i'm a student, so i promised him i would.<n>i promised to go one weekend and it was the most fun i've had in ages, wish i'd gone sooner.<n>you basically pay an extra \u00a310 to rent a gun off the site.<n>\fuuuuuuuuuccckkk\ shot me point blank in the arse with about 7 pellets and i had bruises for about a week.
 my gf had asked me to wash the cat, because it might help her allergies.<n>i tried washing her in the sink, as the results had recommended, but my sink doesn't seal well, so after getting the cat's feet wet, i gave up.<n>i did manage to wash the cat, eventually, but i have been cleaning for about an hour, and i'm still not done.
 i am 16 and have been depressed since i-can't-remember-when, this has made me quite cynical, pessimistic and all around miserable.<n>i've never gotten professional help other than a single visit to a psychologist who hinted i was depressed, though this was a long time ago and it has gotten worse to the point where even an idiot would come to the conclusion that i was depressed.<n>the only person i've told this is a used-to-be-close friend of mine, and that was because she nagged me until i told her what was wrong.
 i suggested danger 5, a pulp magazine-esque satire about a group of five spies whose mission is to stop the nazi's various attempts to take over the world .<n>the humour is not meant for everyone, it has cheesy 60s music, the colour scheme fits with the show and well...it's light hearted about hitler and the nazis .<n>i told her that it's not meant to be offensive, it's just satire and she shouldn't get so offended by it .<n>the next day i get a call from her telling me how i'm insensitive and
 so i'm watching anime, kuroko no basket to be exact (just in case we have any anime fans here) and in between every episode i go on twitter just to refresh my news feed.<n>so i'm scrolling down and i see this one video titled \you can't believe what they're putting in our food now! nasty!!\<n>and it has a pot with like goo in it so i'm thinking \hmm thats interesting! i wonder what they are actually putting in our food!\
 i had a final exam today and my \focus\ was wearing off right as my final was beginning.<n>well half an hour into the exam i come across a tricky problem and take a big breath before starting it.<n>i hadn't spit in a while and my mouth was quite full, and i managed to inhale my dip as well as swallow all the spit.<n>i started coughing and gagging, and shortly after vomit all over my test paper as well as the 2 kids in front of me.<n>everyone looked at me, and i had to take a vomit covered walk of shame to clean myself up as well
 i'm driving through my neighborhood and saw a bunch of frogs chillin outside. one of them was sitting in the middle of the road.<n>i kinda hoped he would be scared of my voice or the fact that my car stopped next to him and hop away, but he just sat there.<n>i realized he'd probably be dead by car in a few hours or so if i didn't act, so i got out to put him on the grass by the road.
 i wanted to sell my graphics card after i upgraded to a new one, so i searched for it on ebay to get an idea for the prices they were selling for .<n>they were lower than i was expecting, but i assumed that was just because it was a relatively old card .<n>so i put it up for auction and give it a buy it now price of $100 (about $20 *above* the price i was expecting) in case someone wants to pay extra and not wait for the end of the auction .<n>5 minutes later, sold for the $100; faster than it took me to set up the
 i was using online banking to balance all my bank and credit card accounts .<n>i shut down immediately to try and interrupt any gutting of my files .<n>i called the bank to let them know that i had been hacked and they may have gotten my online banking username and password .
 we've been together for 5 years and are engaged.<n>One day i came home early from work and he locked himself in the bathroom. turned on the shower, and was on there for longer than usual. when he came out, i noticed he had the remnants of eyeliner around his eyes, but failed to get it off. it was pretty obvious.<n> eventually i started checking the internet history and found he's into tranny vids and kind of put 2 and 2 together.
 A little kid (about 6 or 7) was crying his guts out just a few steps away from me .<n>i assumed he was lost, and, being completely honest, my first reflex was to ignore him and let the security guards take care of reuniting him with his mom .<n>i started chasing him, and a few seconds after leaving the bathroom he tripped and fell to the floor .<n>he obviously started crying. and, oh boy lucky me, his mother was just standing in the counter with a terrified face .
 i was angry with the driver because he was kind of being a dick about it .<n>the last person that saw the email last time thought it was funny but i guess some people just got a huge dick up their ass .<n>i then went back to go check the order and saw that the field for driver directions was filled with a small line of text in german that roughly translated to \all hail the leader\

 my boyfriend and i are both in college, and i wanted him to stay the night.<n>he had a social thing that evening, and i wasn't sure if i'd be awake when he got back, so i left my dorm room door unlocked for him .<n>a few hours later, he came in slightly drunk, got in bed, and we went to sleep. fast forward to 5 am.<n>i'm a light sleeper, and i woke up to what i thought was my boyfriend getting back in bed. he was curled up at the end, which i thought was kinda weird, and kept trying
 i get a sweet tooth, but there's no sweets around, so i decide to whip up some delicious cookies .<n>ten minutes later, i peek at the cookies through the oven window and they're perfect .<n>like a magician with a table cloth i have whipped the rack out of the oven so fast, the cookie sheet and the cookies don't come with it .<n>i watch in that classic, horrified slow-mo as the cookie sheet pauses for a moment in mid-air and then tilts backward, spilling my freshly baked snacks into the back of the super hot oven .
 I was at an embassy New Year's party .<n>The embassy had a candlelight vigil .<n>The speaker stopped talking and just looked at me for 2 seconds .<n>I said somethings that shouldn't have been said... that night i said somethings that shouldn't have been said...

 as the title says, i used to send explicit nsfw pictures of girls to some friends on facebook. whenever i used to discover some really beautiful pictures of naked girls (which i used reddit for), i couldn't resist showing them to some of my friends.<n>i got my first warning from facebook almost a year ago after sending some pictures to a friend. the warning told me that i was sending pornographic pictures which was against the rules of facebook.<n>i ignored the warning and thought that if i waited a couple of weeks before sending another picture, i would be fine.

 i saw this pretty decent size gorilla (maybe 400-500 pounds) and the zoo wasn't very busy so when he saw me, he got really close to the bars .<n> fortunately the bars of the cage were narrow so the gorilla couldn't actually reach out and grab people .<n>i put my hand out and get a few inches from him, but i got scared and pulled my hand back.<n>the gorilla didn't make any sudden movements, just kind of looking down and peeking up at me every once in a while.

 i asked her to give me a flash drive so i could put some college stuff in it a few months ago; to be safe, i copied all of her stuff and put it on my computer.<n>i erased the contents of the flash drive as to avoid them getting stolen or to prevent malfunction: where me and my class mates print out projects, the printing machine malfunctions and we believe it happens if you have anything other than what you want to print on your flash drive.<n>the problem is i think i put them in my laptop, which bluescreened on me so i reinstalled windows and upgraded it's videocard, so

 when we got there, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that this was the most run down movie theater i have ever been to .<n>the movie was supposed to start at 4 but i thought ads would take 20 min.<n>the ads continued until 4:30 and thats when we began getting annoyed at how long it was taking. sadly that would end up being a mistake.<n>we were exhausted from the ads though and just wanted to get to the movie. confusion struck even more as the cashier said the movie ends around 6. that would make it a very short movie.
 20 years old, have the whole city at my fingertips .<n>i don't know anyone my own age, can't legally drink, and only have enough cash to cover public transportation and frugal grocery shopping .<n>my social interaction comes from coworkers (30+) and the slew of awesome international tech developers i live with .
 i woke up with a dark thing just under the head of my penis .<n>it hurt a little, and i couldn't take it off, but i assumed it was a piece of dry skin or something .<n>i went to the beauty salon of the hotel, where i got some tweezers and a private room to remove the tick .
 I started secretly dating my friend's sister. no one knew about our relationship, absolutely no one .<n>We started exchanging nude pics. she had to leave town for a couple of days so we started exchanging nude pics.<n> one of those days i met her brother (my friend) and was having a smoke with him. right between the smoking, she sent me a nude pic.<n>i saw it quite discreetly and kept the phone back in my pocket. now, curse android. if you don't hit the home button before locking, the last thing you saw stays on the screen after unlocking.
 whenever i open this pool, there's a pretty girl around my age (20) who comes in for her daily morning swim .<n>As i went over the pool with my skimmer i notice a fairly large (but dead) spider floating around .<n>Instead of landing at her feet, it hits her right in the *goddamn face*.<n>she starts screaming bloody murder and flings herself into the pool where she immediately swallows a fairly large amount of water .
 this was my first fuck up, trusting my fart while sick .<n>my stomach burst into anarchy as the wonka river spewed across the tub and shower walls .<n> finally got all cleaned up and left the scene of the crime .
 she encouraged me to buy more, but i said i didn't feel like spending any more and that we'd be fine. she seemed less sure, but obliged.<n> continuing on with the pace of the week, we continued our wild sex romp in the vacation rental house.<n>About a half hour ago i get a text from her saying that she's a week late for her period, and that she bought a pregnancy test.<n>i do not have the money to become a father, nor do i think i'm ready to be a good one.
 after using the computer after i was done, to my dismay, i noticed that the f, v, and r key stopped working .<n>Here is where the real fuck up is: the password to my computer is \fuckyou\
 my girlfriend and i have been in a relationship for three years.<n>i've always had to work on her birthday, but promised that i'd spend it with her this year.<n>i cleared the weekend, secured a ride down to where she was (we live together, but she generally celebrates about 100 miles south of where we live, in her hometown)<n>my gf told me her mother wouldn't allow the dog down there anyway, and that i should just take the work i dropped for the weekend, take the following weekend off, and spend the weekend together.
 when i stayed in bed for two hours using the vibrator externally, full speed pretty much the whole time.<n>i literally lost control of my overly full bladder and peed myself, clothed and all, in my driveway.<n>i swear that this only happens in the sims or in depends commercials.<n>i am aware that there can be serious nerve damage from overuse of vibrators on sensitive parts of the body.
 i had a really nice laptop. 8gigs of ram, solid state drive, blazing fast and full of cool shit.<n>After awhile it started overheating and shutting down.<n>It was still a great machine, but games with serious physics were too much.<n>i mentioned this to a friend and he offers to clean the fan and reapply thermal paste. neat.<n>i had tried to do that but the design was a pain in the ass and i didn't want to get in over my head.
 i decided to go for a run in 95 degree heat and 100% humidity. it\u2019s humid to the point that the humidity sweats.<n>to combat the sweating in more promiscuous regions, formally known as swamp balls, i decided to apply baby powder.
 20 minutes ago i was jerking off, but i didn't realize my dick was pointing straight at my face so i jizzed full force into my poor poor eyeball .<n>like that jizz stuff that spiderman uses. now my eyeball is super red and aches pretty bad.
 i recently met and messaged a woman on an online dating site .<n>The conversation grew very sexual as we both became turned on by the thought of this little taboo .<n>The sex in hind site was, okay at best, and personally i would rather not continue the 'affair' any longer that one time .<n>But the fact that this woman knows my family and apparently had a fling with my brother in law at some point in the distant past, which she mentioned after coitus, makes this a little challenging .
 My friend and I are both single and going off to college this fall .<n>We have recently met up and just chatted for a while at a coffee shop a couple times .<n>We have both suffered from similar health problems throughout high school .<n>We have a special understanding of each other that people that haven't had 24/7 migraines for the past couple years just don't have .
 i'm on vacation in inador with my family and i was taking a long walk far away from the nearest restroom .<n>i put my dick back in my pants, then i look to the left and to my horror, there is a long strip of liquid on the left side of my shorts .
 dj casper started singing commands at everyone.<n>i start bumping into people left and right, stepping on feet etc, continue like that for 4 minutes, and i'm thoroughly embarrassed by the end of the song.
 i was charged an extra $25 because the cashier thought i was buying 5 reusable bags, that i already bought .<n>Since after construction and college i am in debt i flip out and **smash** my gf's microwave .<n>my gf was so pissed by then she grabbed the hammer, nailed me in the fucking balls again, and literally kicked me out of the house .<n>i am in over $5000 worth of criminal related charges, have to pay for the man's medical bill, for my gfs destroyed kitchen and kitchen appliances, and may have to do community service .
 i got high on edibles today while the wife was out shopping and i had to watch after my 8 yo son and 4 yo daughter.<n>during one scene we see plankton's restaurant name: \chum bucket,\ at which point i chuckled and said out loud: \don't you mean cum bucket\
 i skipped last year's picnic but decided to check it out this year after having heard a few interesting things .<n>i picked one, got dressed and drove to the park with a couple of my friends .<n>i soon noticed people giving off this strange vibe. there were a lot of stares directed towards me .<n>i tried to explain to the guard that the logo was from a tv show and that i was in no way affiliated to the other isis making headlines in the news.<n> surprisingly enough, i found my wallet as well and made my way out, covering up my t-shirt with a
 I'm an incredibly shy guy around women.<n>This new girl at my work shows up, and she's *gorgeous*.<n>i make my way around to asking her if she'd any plans after work, and she said no.<n>i make my way around to asking her if she'd any plans after work, and she said no.<n>i wait until she's off to text her, and ask if she'd like me to pick her up for breakfast. no response.
 One day being drunk old me decided to ask a girl out .<n>Instead of backing the fuck up, i sent her a message: \it's not the movie, it's you!\<n>Now everyone is messing with me at school since she told the *smiles trying not to be awkward* to everyone .
 laziness ensues and my pumpkin ends up on my balcony for the next six months.<n>i vow to give it a proper burial in the complex dumpster.<n>i come home today and my elevator is broken. i proceed to walk up five flights of stairs and open my apartment door, winded because again, laziness.<n>the first thing i see are black spots littering my walls and i think \holy hell i'm about to pass out from walking up stairs?\ imagine if you will my excitement at realizing my apartment is instead full of fat ass flies.
 when i was in 3rd grade, the school had just gotten some soccer net frames that for a while were just down to bare metal .<n>i liked to play on them during recess, since there wasn't a jungle gym on the school's playground, and the back end made a great balance beam .<n>my teacher runs over yelling at me. he tells me to get off of there because the frames got painted white and they were drying .<n>my reputation in elementary school instantly became the childhood equivalent of a rapist .
 I was in an awesome relationship and I was just starting to discover the magical effects of marijuana .<n>I woke up in a healing amount of pain. my back felt as if someone had taken a razor and shaved all of my skin off, and my head felt like someone's was driving an ice pick through it.<n>i was home alone for the day, and in all my teenage brilliance i thought that weed and vicodin was the answer. lots of weed and lots of vicodin.<n>i stayed in there for what felt like an hour, and when i came out i was baffled by what i saw
 my friend ian is a huge genesis fan. in my band class, when we are switching between songs, ian busts out in a drum solo.<n>the band director usually gets him to stop, but today, she couldn't.<n>i shouted back at him \hey, ian, you're not phil collins from devo!\ he stood up and yelled even louder \phil collins was in genesis, dipshit!\
 i woke up at about 4:30 which is usual for me because i leave the house at 440 to go to work.<n>i grabbed my jeans threw them into the bathroom next to the shower and went to the restroom.<n>i then put my pants on noticed that they were damp and said to myself that it must have been water from the shower last night.<n>around this time i noticed a very strong odour.<n>i realized that what i thought was water was perhaps not water. now this particular odour is only found from animals of the feline variety.
 i close my eyes to wash my face, but when i open them again, and look at my hands, they are completely red with blood .<n>completely freaked out, i try to wash it all towards the plughole, while franticly looking for what i expected would be a massive gash somewhere on my body .<n> realised that the sauce of all the blood was just a small nose bleed which i had somehow opened up again from when i smacked myself in the face with my camera a few days earlier .
 this week is \teacher appreciation week\ at my high school .<n>A class mate of mine brought our government teacher a coke .<n>well near the end of class he had dropped the coke and set it on his desk upside down .
 my family had decided to throw a house party for a bunch of family friends and various co workers we've known throughout the years.<n>after about 4 hours of pre gaming, watching hockey, basketball, horse races, nascar, playing bags and just chillin and drinking.<n>we are all having a great time and my first fuck up is having a crown, cranberry and red bull mixed drink that truly tastes like fucking heaven in a glass.<n>i was feeling good and proceeded to lose $150 dollars in bags in a very intense close game that was being commentated by the other intoxicated patrons of the party.<n>
 one slip of the finger turned \regards\ into \retards\<n> once i was informed of my fuckup, i had to issue an apology and correction to all the recipients .
 this fuck up took place inside a a room in my school that is specifically dedicated to a place to put your bag .<n>i was in here, just after lunch, eating my bread roll as i usually do. as a joke i began ripping pieces of bread off and throwing it at one of my friends.<n>my friend, being a drama llama, cowarded in the corner, again as a joke. about half way through the roll of bread, when my friend pointed behind me at something that i assumed was another of my friends.<n>it unfortunately wasn't my friend as i assumed, but was my principal
 i was driving my company's box truck, as i do like 3 times a week.<n>i don't know what the hell i was thinking... there was a car in front of me, prepping to make a left turn but was waiting for the oncoming traffic to break.<n>my mirror clips a telephone pole on the passenger side, my tire hops the curb which sends the top right corner of the box into the pole, leaving a nice gouge in the metal.<n>the truck kicks off the curb and tilts 45 degrees in the other direction, scraping the side of the 3-passenger car and then rights itself.
 one day, one of my employee (a girl) came to me and said that she saw me driving out of a gas station while she was driving in. she waved at me but she could not get my attention. then she said that she should have just honk.<n>i told her: i would have fingered you if you did. she was like what!?!?
 i have a super cheap electric razor that is pretty rough, and so i have to be really careful so as to not get any razerburn on my face .<n>well, my mom was saying that since i had such a cheap razor, and there was a Costco coupon for a nicer one, i could get a nicer one along with my brother .<n>after making it clear that she should use my dad's razor, she promised she would never use it again .
 i mentioned to new dealer coworker that i need bud for sister and i completely casually, didn't think twice about it.<n> fast forward again to driving home when she called me, livid that i mentioned it, since she explicitly said not to...fuck. so obviously having mention of an illegal drug could hinder those chances of promotion...especially if the dealer, i later found out, has had drunken of flings with current gm...who also has a boyfriend - damn this industry is scandalous.
 i was texting my friend while walking into the elevator so i wasn't really paying attention, and i accidentally walked into the closing doors of the elevator.<n>my arms splayed out to the side and my phone went flying.<n>i picked up my phone, and i was looking for cracks in my screen as i tried to get into the elevator, and i walked into the closing doors of the elevator twice.<n>in the span of 30 seconds.
 i was getting on a tram, and had my phone in my hand, because i was typing a message.<n> since i was done using my phone, i put it in the front pocket of my jeans.<n>what i didn't know was that the pocket had a huge-ass hole in it. now, my phone is very small -- it's a[ ericsson k750i](http://www.mobiset.ru/photo/sonyericsson/k750i/sonyericsson_k750i_1748d.jpg)
 i posted an ad on kijiji saying that i am looking for work, particularly general labour because i'm experienced in landscaping and what have you.<n>a guy answers my ad the next day and says that he needs work done around his property that would include lots of digging, shoveling, heavy lifting etc.<n>no problem, i'll be there and ready to work.<n>i've spent roughly six hours hauling bricks, gravel and dirt out of this guy's massive yard.<n>around noon i had realized that perhaps i was working too hard in order to impress this guy and that i wouldn't make
 Last week my finances mom died. She always said she hated that she never wore dresses.<n>She immediately had to go buy a new dress because her mom always said she hated that she never wore dresses.<n>The other day she tries it on with her bra because boobs. she puts in on and asks what i think.<n>\it makes my eyes hurt.\ you'd have thought i started world war 9.<n>She returned the dress because she said all she would think at the funeral would be 'it makes my eyes hurt.' yup, thankfully she is still marrying me.
 i did my wonderful 45 minute workout and was looking forward to a nice cool sudsy shower.<n>i get some music going and i'm covered in bubbly soap and enjoying myself, so i start shaving.<n>i was gleefully depilating my southern girl when my left hand and my razor got really excited about their new idea... to shave inside!<n>i stared at my crotch for about 20 seconds before it really set in that half of my brain had attempted to cut off my built in senzu bean.
 I was driving my girlfriend home from a communion luncheon .<n>We were on a dirt road that is pretty narrow and wooded on both sides .<n>The cake flew forward and plops frosting side down on the carpet. she is screaming about some bug in her bra so i get out and try to help her. eventually she calms down but we can\u2019t find whatever bug was allegedly attacking her.<n>i do my best to clean up what i can of the cake by scooping it up with my hands and throwing it into the woods. she is freaked out that it is somewhere hiding in the passenger seat so i sit
 i will never know the struggles that a person of a different sexual orientation goes through on a daily basis .<n>It was never my intention to shame a girl with a bigger body type .<n>i hadn't been laid in a couple weeks, and didn't think to get some of the lead out prior to our rendezvous .
 i forgot to put the laptop in the car .<n>i was fairly new at this job at the time and the laptop was not a cheap one, it's an hp elitebook that was worth around 2k$ back then .
 i see that the only route available takes me through the men's and women's washroom and into the office space .<n>While i'm in the celing i hear someone come into the washroom and go to the one beside me .<n>some woman has decided the stall adjacent to me is the best seat in the house .
 i work in an office, sitting at a computer all day. for the past week or so, i've had a bad cold.<n>i'm sitting there working, and a particularly big sneeze hits. this felt like i sneezed in more than one place.<n>i get up a few minutes later, inconspicuously inspect the gray seat cushion while getting my water.
 i live in kuwait, and it was around 35 degrees celsius today (can't wait for summer)<n>people also tend to be assholes (bonus douchebaggery for high school), and everyone picks on this one kid in my class, let's call him ned.<n>so at school, on the last floor, we have a single activities room with access to the roof, however the door to the rooftop is generally kept closed. today, the door was open and the devilish heat was creeping in. apparently ned was out there, and the shitty door's handles were broken on either
 i offered to move the best man's truck that was illegally parked so he didn't have to worry about it .<n>i lock the truck and start to walk away and someone else who happened to be outside says, \you know you lost your cooler, right?\<n>i pick up all the glass i could. found a groomsman and explained the situation and had to drive to the nearest liquor store and drop $300 on crown, crown apple, fireball, and captain .
 after about half an hour of trying to get someone to pull over to help me, i am shedding tears and screaming \good samaritans of interstate .<n>i was freaking out and didn't think to call 911 so my dad told me that would probably be the best course of action.<n>i was sitting in my car when the police finally showed up. the officer jumped my car and told me it was probably either a battery or alternator problem.
 i was with my parents on some errands and i took their car keys to try out their car's proximity sensor on the door .<n>i tried it many times, without success, so i gave up and headed back to my parents inside a store .<n> moments later, a cop car pulled up and two cops entered the building i was in, asking who i was with and left .<n>a few minutes later, two more cops pulled up, for a total of 3 cop cars, and another cop entered my building asking if anyone was the owner of my parents' car, because they had gotten a call from
 i had just become friends with a new kid named dylan.<n>After a week or so he invites me and my friend brandon over to his house for some good times.<n>However he warns me that his parents are a little crazy and to just walk straight to his room when i get there.<n>We get our \supplies\ and start walking to dylan's house.
 i've never had a facebook account, just never saw the point, and my friends have asked me to get one for a while.<n>They said that a lot of messaging happens on it so it would useful to have.<n>Also, i think i'm pretty fucking hilarious at times.
 when i pulled out the receipt, the machine gave it a slight push .<n>since all laws of physics seem to hate me in that situation they let the receipt fall into the crate part of the machine .<n>A little boy, who had been behind me, starts climbing into the machine to get my receipt for me .
 when i went in i got the soda and everything and while i was checking out, this like 20'something year old guy started talking about how i have a really good tan (i'm half black)<n>So i told him that i was half black and he said in like the stereotypical racist southern manner \yo blood be tainted boy\ and then he spit on my hoodie which really pissed me the fuck off .<n>i was eventually not charged because he did instigate me by spitting on me .
 Our bathroom is located inside our office in a small room at the back of the sales floor .<n>i went for my daily 11 o clock poo, pants down at the ankles, sat there on the throne playing some game, when suddenly the handle goes .<n>the poor filipino walks in, sees me there, pants down, squeezing one out and she just stares at me in horror, screams and runs out .
 i accepted a short term position in australia to help out with a project for several months.<n>we had two full days in townsville, and we made the most of it .<n> townsville is up in the north-east part of australia, and is pretty much just hot all year round.<n>our first night, we were setup in the guest bedroom, which did have an ac unit. however, something was wrong with it \u2013 it was just pushing out air, not cool air. we ended up sleeping in that room that night but it was pretty difficult \u2013 hot & stuffy and not comfortable at all, so we
 my uncle is a human rights activist and is involved with several other \rights\ groups. he has a name built up for himself, and it's not all good.<n>years ago, before he had a rather bad name built up for himself, he had asked me for a favour .<n>he had asked me to record him with a video cam while he delivered a written and verbal statement to the head of the department of fisheries .<n>i agreed to help him, as i didn't see any issues with this and while doing so there was no rejection to what he was doing or for me having the camera
 at that age, nudity was the ultimate shame .<n>i dared her, and she undressed piece by piece until she was stark naked .<n>my mother scolded me but fortunately realised there were no hidden intentions .
 i have back and neck problems and often will ice my neck with ice packs .<n>well last night i couldn't find our ice packs and was too lazy to make my own so i grabbed a frozen bag of peas .<n>i settled into bed with it on my neck.<n>i fell asleep like that and woke up hours later laying on top of the smashed bag of peas and my bed soaked in pea juice all the way down into the mattress .
 i set two alarms to wake up early for a job trial, with the alarm next to my pillow so id hear it.<n> suddenly i wake up and look at the clock again 2 hours after i was supposed to start and 3 missed calls from the potential boss.<n>too embarrased to call him back, so back to looking for jobs.
 i met a german exchange student girl and became good friends.<n>i drove her home to her house, and we just got to know each other pretty well.<n>well, about 1 month before graduation, she calls me up, crying, and says that she just broke up with her boyfriend because of me.<n>i had started my first pretty serious relationship with a foreign girl, and we only had a matter of weeks to develop that relationship before it all went south.
 The project is made by a group of five, we all chose separate subjects to write for and i said i would edit it all together.<n>everyone involved eventually sent me their work except for one.<n>the one in our group who never even responded to my emails eventually sent me some bullshit paragraph about an hour after our deadline.<n>i copy pasta everything and decide not to submit this under the inherent belief that i should probably read the thing at least once before i send it.
 kevin, john, riley, and carl come over to hang out in my garage .<n>John and carl are on-board, so me and kevin are just like screw it, let's go .<n>Each time we've ding dong ditched someone's house, we are taking turns on who rings the doorbell .
 i started talking more with a girl who i was acquainted with in 8th grade. we'll call her ashley.<n>during that time, i started talking more with a girl who i was acquainted with in 8th grade.<n>i was having an internal debate of either to go after my crush at the time (we'll call her brittany), or try and go for ashley. me being completely naive chose the former, and even sent the friend a message saying,**'i would, but i have a crush on another girl'**.<n>the day after that i asked her if i could make her
 i had to cut my grass for the first time this year because it was getting bad .<n>my electric weed eater is only about 20 feet which means i have to unplug it and put it in another section of the house and hang it out the window .<n>so i get to the last little part of the yard and my only option to plug it in is to unplug my deep freezer, no big deal, its only going to take about 10 minutes to do the lawn, my meat will be fine!<n>flash forward tonight, i open the freezer to get something out for dinner tomorrow, and realize that not only did
 i got concussed about a month ago by a pillow thrown at me by my boyfriend .<n>My phone screen still looks blue and i keep thinking people are shouting at me .<n>I went to the docs like a week later and he said i could have the sensitivity for up to a month... fast forward to now... my phone screen still looks blue and i keep thinking people are shouting at me .
 i was with my friends in our gym today and i saw a kid playing basketball and i thought we would have a 1 on 1 game so i playfully steal the ball from him and shuffle around a little .<n>Turns out he was a special education kid at our school.
 my roommates and i didn't have any plans so i decided to call it an early night.<n>an hour after i went to sleep a few people came over, but i being in my warm comfortable bed couldn't be bothered to come out.<n>They then decide to bang on my door/wall for 10 minutes until i finally give in and come out of my room looking like a total scrub: hair not cut in a couple of months, not having shaved in a few weeks, old soccer shorts, old glasses because i ran out of contacts, and a faded one love bob marley tee, not to mention the
 i was with a couple and we had two rooms in at least a five star hotel. the chick took much less mild shrooms while me and her boyfriend took the Hawaiians.<n>the bathroom door was made of glass, which was kind of trippy for all of us.<n>i went up to my room thinking to sleep but learned this lesson - \never ever leave a person alone on Hawaiian shrooms.\<n>i created my own hell inside my hotel room. it was extremely hot so i stripped.<n>the next thing i remember was looking at my penis wondering what the fuck it was.

 My whole diet was based off of dishes that i was able to microwave .<n>i always cooked my rice in one of [these](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/main/72853/black-24oz-7-x-5x-2-rectangular-microwavable container-withlidlidcasecasejpg)
 five years ago when i was a young and stupid in college i went with some friends to an off campus party.<n>everything was pretty chill and relaxing so i decided now was as a good time as any to chug as many beers as i could to get my buzz on.<n>One of her friends brought a bong and i figured i would join them to show how much fun i was.<n>my crush hands me the bong, i take one long inhale, hold my breath for an eternity and release. immediately, i creep back into my seat and start to question why that seemed like a good idea.
 i bought a can of cheap-as-shit pepper spray from fry's and left it in my truck for when i had to throw trash away at night. tonight was the first time i had occasion to use it so i pulled it out and hosed down the trash bin without aiming at anything in particular.<n>i grabbed a bag of trash from the truck, went to throw it away, and stepped right into the cloud of pepper spray.<n>i honestly had no idea what happened at first as my vision went blurry and my nose started burning. but then it got worse and i realized what the fuck my dumb
 i got up way too late in the morning debated breakfast and skipped it anyways .<n>Went to work mins before my manager and acted like i have been at the desk for more time than i was .<n> walked down to the second floor to have a smoke and coffee .<n>While still on the call with my mom and strolling in the second floor i come across this \pull lever incase of fire\ lever .<n>All i did was run my hands on the lever like they do with smooth skin chicks in commercials .

 the night before taking into the local maaco, my buddies came over, and decorated it with spray paint, with a variety of nice dirty words and penises sprayed all over the place.<n>the unfortunate thing for us was that the maaco $99 paint job didn't include a primer coat, and the spray painted decorations showed through, plain as day, after the paint job was finished.
 i was at work on cash ringing through peoples food, and as this restaurant is located in a hospital it tends to get pretty busy.<n>well he gave me the most serious poker face i have ever seen and said to me \that's my wife\.<n>i must have turned as red as a fire engine while i calmly apologized and scanned my surroundings for any fucking excuse to leave the area and settled on getting some cups to restock while my coworker, who heard everything, went to finish the transaction with a huge grin on her face.
 i inherited an old ford Ltd that was huge, canary yellow, and had a ford 351 \cleveland\ v-8. it was technically my fist car, so i loved it.<n>i decided to tune it up, so one night i went to my buddy's work, and used their shop to do a full tune up- new plugs, wires and distributor cap.<n>after replacing the parts, i started to play with the throttle controller to hear if it was misfiring...but man, that intoxicating sound of a v8 running at full throttle got to me, and i started to show off
 i ordered a footlong ham and cheese, 2 cookies, bottled water and some chips.<n>in retrospect, the chips may be the culprit as they were a flavor i've never tried before.<n>i sat in my car and wolfed down my meal, downed the cookies, water and chips and returned to the 72 degree climate controlled training room.<n>an hour later, i sensed a disturbance in my bowels as something...something evil...was trying to break free from its dark prison.

 after inching along for what seemed like forever, i made it to an exit that would take me to work .<n>this isn't the normal way i go, because this way is takes a little longer and is a single lane each way road for a few miles .<n>because i'm such a good guy, i decide to pull over and stop, get out, and remove the low hanging limb so nobody else has to swerve or cracks their windshield .<n>put the truck in 4wd... no luck.<n>Luckily i have towing insurance (only through certain tow services), and a coworker was nearby and

 A horny 16 year old boy (hard to picture right?) looking for new things to try .<n>He tried toothpaste as a lube because he thought it's consistency would make for an interesting feel .<n>After 30 seconds, he could start to feel the pain of the cold air on his dick .<n>He sat in his bathroom for the next 10 minutes holding his poor penis in agony .
 i went back home today extra horny for some odd reason and i quickly rushed my steps and opened my pc while ignoring every other thing in my room.<n>i choose one of the weirdest videos i ever downloaded (i never watched it before , just downloaded it.) and it appeared to be truley messed up, yet i got aroused by it and jerked to it really hard .<n>while having fun jerking it off and hearing something among the lines of 'that's better than my sister!'<n>i hear the voice of my mother coming from my bed saying 'i'm not cleaning that up
 when all of a sudden i see a figure appear in my doorway.<n>my first thought is... you are just hallucinating go back to sleep so i fall back into a microsleep for another second.<n>the next time i open my eyes though the figure is closer.<n>the shadowy figure seemed to just be standing there not moving and in my drug and fever induced mind i now believe that my house has been broken into and that someone is trying to attack me in my sleep without waking me up!<n>Luckily though i am not a violent man ( i have never even gotten into a fist fight) but sometimes i still
 i was in a nice relationship with this girl, les. we were young, happy, and horny .<n>during the time we were together, i spent a month abroad traveling with my family, while she stayed home .<n>i noticed my girlfriend growing a bit pale. at first i thought nothing of it since, hey, my penis can only get so erect - and let me tell you, it was that erect, in front of her grandfather and mother .<n>i subsequently received one more \i'm going to kill you\ stare from her grandfather before he left the room .
 I have been a lurker for the longest time, and recently my friend reminded me of a fu i had not to long ago.<n>My gf has been moving from place to place recently and the place she is at now is full on ghetto town.<n>I just dropped my gf at her house and as im backing out i see this black guy who is wearing all blue and is wearing a mask, who i can safely assume was a crib gang member.<n>I thought this guy was either hurt really bad and was trying to get my help or he was faking it and he was going to pull out a gun and

 i had just turned 18 a few months ago and had gotten the dreaded jury duty letter.<n>my dad during his morning ritual - sitting at the kitchen table, reading the morning paper and drinking coffee out of his mug with the big bold lettering - coffee makes me poop.<n>i lock my doors and quickly bolt to the elevator.<n>i hurriedly tap the down button while clenching my butt cheeks together as sweat starts to gather on my brow.<n>i pull my pants off, grab a spare towel in my backseat and clean myself and my car as well as i can for the time being.
 i have a dog and when we got our new security system we had an extra camera so we could have fun and see what our crazy dog does all day .<n> anyway, my wife and co workers were excited to watch the dog and see what he does, as we've come home to him having built a fort of sorts out of couch pillows and a couple if light blankets we have on the couches .<n>well, they logged into a live feed of me jerking it on the couch... she said she closed it as fast as possible and said nothing. people just walked away and no one has said a
 i picked up the cat and plunked her on the kitchen table, then started giving her heavy pets to calm her .<n>from the far end of the table she mrowed again and started moving around in a goofy half-crouch, like she couldn't stand up properly .<n>i've injured my little cat bud, who's walking around like she's either hurt or constipated .
 my dog currently has two broken legs and has to stay in a play pen at almost all times .<n>i decided since the smell of his poop was so bad that i should tie a scarf around the bottom half of my face to prevent the smell from getting to me to badly .<n> needless to say it backfired. i had a vomit rag literally tied to my face.

 i was in the silent study area of the library, the place is deathly quiet, so as cautiously as i could i made my way to the toilets.<n>these toilets aren\u2019t your standard large room with several stalls and urinals etc. they were individual restrooms with a sink and a toilet, like disabled toilets without all the bars and safety cords.<n>these toilets are separated from the silent study area by only a door, when they are flushed, the entire silent study area (which was occupied by around 200 people) could hear.<n>my laughing fit lasted for a solid minute until it subsided and i realised a lot
 i was out at a party getting hammered and blazin, no biggie right, wrong.<n> towards the end of the night we stopped to get some mcdonald's, no biggie right, wrong.<n>so i get home pretty late and pass out on my bed immediately, forgetting about practice and not setting my alarm.<n>so anyways i'm at practice, finally starting to gain some energy, and i realize that i need to unleash a very destructive, bottled up shit from the night before.<n>i figured i would try to make it through practice so coach wouldn't get pissed. halfway through, we line up

 my dog was happily sleeping on my bed when i looked down after a smelled a smelly smell from said dog, and looked around to try and see what the cause was.<n>i look under my desk and see a what i thought was a perfectly shaped poop.<n>i yelled at my dog and sent her outside in the heat after a scolding and giving her the look from hell.<n>well i then came back to my room and proceeded to put on my glasses and realised that i had yelled at my dog over a black pen lid.<n>the damn pen lid was not a perfectly laid shit but a discarded pen lid.
 i'm 17 now, and have become accustomed to the onslaught of jokes that he makes whenever we go somewhere together .<n>he makes one final pun. \orange you glad you got to serve us today?\ the cashier laughs and then her face turns into shock .<n>the person down the line from us calls an ambulance, and the security from the shopping centre come running in, and my dad, a certified first aid trainer, is trying to help her breathe .<n> turns out she was just having some allergic reaction to something in the air, and just needed an epi-pen that she had right near her

 i was going to change into my last pair of contacts today.<n>as per usual, tossed them into the toilet.<n>i opened one lens and put it in fine, but when i went to put in the other, i realized there was a puncture in the little foil cover.<n>all the solution had leaked out, leaving my remaining lens a dried-up, crackled, unusable mess.<n> needless to say, i bobbed my lens out of the toilet, it as best i could, and prayed not to get an eye infection.

 my brain immediately does what it does best and overthinks the worst case scenario. she could have been hurt, someone there could have been hurt, she may have just gotten into an argument and she is going to be hurt (not joking all of these ran through my head).<n>i then begin to drive over there and on the way i call and text her repeatedly trying to get ahold of her.<n>i wait until 4:30 am calling and texting trying to get ahold of her making a total of 40 calls/texts and at this point honestly thinking she could be dead because that's how my mind works.

 to plug it in a normal outlet i would have to put it on the floor; if i plug it in my pc the phone can just sit on my desk.<n>the latter just seemed more convenient. after a few years i finally got an outlet close enough to my desk... so i just started using it.<n>Now it still took me a while to figure out because i'm not checking my phone that regularly while it's charging, but the damn thing charges up at least twice as fast.
 my friend offered to watch my girls for a few days this week because she is taking vacation time and she is glutton for punishment.<n>my kids typically attend day care, and i thought it was only fair if i drove them to her house since she is watching them for free.<n>i have been extra forgetful lately, and i always have a hard time differentiating her house from the others in her subdivision.

 i woke up at 6-7am on christmas morning to see if there was anything special from santa this year .<n>my parents sometimes setup cool toys and stuff that were already built and everything by the tree in the mornings from 'santa'<n>i was the only one awake at the time, so i figured i'd give it an hour then go wake everyone up if they weren't already .<n>i finish opening everything and go back to watching tv and playing with some of my presents while i wait for everyone to come down and see what a good job i did opening everything for them .
 i chose a theater with reserved seating and purposefully chose a seat in the 2nd to final row, off to the side and away from the existing reservation majority in the center of the theater.<n>another late arrival, a couple this time, starts making their way up and chooses the very last row behind me along with seats behind mine off to the left.<n>i can't fucking believe these people, talking during the movie then they leave their cell phone notification shit on. so i turn around and ask them in a rather forceful way if they could please be decent humans and shut off their mouths and phones.
 i was excited for Christmas this year because i managed to save up $200 to buy my wife a nice gift .<n>i took the day off of work and had made plans to check out several stores.<n>i started to wonder if i could get away with doing all my christmas shopping online? fifteen minutes later i had found exactly what i needed and was feeling pretty good about myself.<n>i knocked over a bottle of water and shorted the laptop.<n>i need this computer for work, so instead of getting my wife a christmas gift this year, i\u2019ll be explaining to her that i had to purchase a new motherboard

 one kid in the group, let's call him v, unfortunately had to go through his father passing away around 2 years earlier .<n>i think he noticed suddenly that v was a bit on edge because he thought we'd forgotten about his dad and we'd ask him .<n>i turn to him and casually ask \so what about your-\ and before i even finish the sentence he just straight up mutters \my dads dead\
 i was reading through the roommate lease to make the check out to.<n>i thought the named looked a little different than what the ad said her name was.<n>\well, maybe i'm just tired from work and such.\ so i grab the lease to make sure and look at the original ad and sure enough, the names are different.<n>this is where i start realizing the fuck up: i type the name on the lease into google and it explodes with all this information about this type of cult.<n>i've really no idea what to do at this point, but hoping since it's just a

 i bought a new screen for it and repaired it. so i restored it through itunes only to find that it had been activation locked through the original owner.<n>Luckily there was a phone number(with no area code, for some reason) on the message so that i could call the owner of the phone.<n>i asked her if she lost an iphone in january, and she asked if it was a cracked, blue iphone 5c. i had her phone so immediately she cracked a bitchy attitude asking where she could pick up her phone.<n>i told her i don't trust her to come to my home, and
 i stopped smoking marijuana about 3 weeks prior while i was job hunting.<n>i was surprised they removed 3 spots the size of a pencil eraser from the back of my head.<n>i felt like a criminal, with patchy hair, sent home from work, being talked down to by some judgemental doctor in salt lake city of all places.

 i had been planning this hike through mt nebo, near to brisbane, for about 9 months now .<n>We finally got the go ahead to do it, but because it had got pushed back so far it was now in the middle of winter .<n>The next day was the hardest - about 12km, with a total of 365 meters down, and 475 meters up .<n>we eventually made our way through massive overgrowth down into a creek that we knew ran towards our next checkpoint .<n>then i dropped my phone, the only one with power left, into the creek and we ended up
 i met this one guy who out of all the people i had met so far had very similar interests to me .<n>he would start getting pushy about it and would go as far as lying and saying my friends (which he does not know at all) were also going out to the same party .<n>thinking back to my old depression, i realized that i should put myself first sometimes .<n>i am still with the same girl to this day. she is a champion for putting up with my shit .
 sensory deprivation tanks consist of a \pod\ or room filled with skin-temperature water that has dissolved magnesium sulfate, or epsom salt, in it.<n> users float naked in the chamber, and the salt gives the body more buoyancy and allows it to float on the water without effort, and, combined with the temperature of the water, gives the feeling of weightlessness.
 i walked into a fucking metal box and destroyed my knee. it ripped a hole in the only pair of pants they issued me, and now my knee is bleeding.<n>i don't know if they'll charge me for the pants if i'm honest about how i injured myself and they'll probably not want me to wear ripped pants to work tomorrow but it's the only ones they issued me.<n>i told my boss i cut my pants and knee and she didn't care at all or ask how it happened.<n>i then asked what to do about the pants and it turns out our company

 i feel completely worthless, used, and hurt, not to mention ashamed and in bad standing with my parents.<n>i also got somewhat fired from my job at the coolest coffee shop ever.<n>it sucks to think i could have not worked at all and if i had just been a good kid, i would have been much healthier, richer, and happier then i am right now.
 since there's nothing in my room that i use except for my bed, i never really go into that room except to sleep.<n> turns out my cat decided to shit on my bed sometime recently.<n>As soon as i plop down on my bed i land on the pile of cat shit with it hitting almost square in the middle of my chest.<n>It wasn't still warm, but it was still nice and soft and at least one tootsie roll sized chuck managed to stick to my chest as i lifted myself up.

 he kept calling them souvenir checks, and saying that we weren't allowed to spend them, so i went up to him and asked, \hey, can you give me 20k for a new car?\ and this idiot actually gave me a check.<n>i asked my mom if i could go cash it, saying a friend gave it to me, which was technically true. she was suspicious though, took the check and called his parents, who threatened to get police involved if we didn't give back the money.<n>Mom was pissed, grounded me for a month and gave them all the money back.

 i remembered that i had taken some pictures of the view on my phone during the trip, but i also forgot that said picture of the view was sandwiched between pictures that my girlfriend took of her boobs, some goofy faces, my bulge, a few strips of bacon, and a 3d puzzle turtle.<n>i carefully chose a picture of the view between 2 other pictures that were close to the same view in case she swiped left or right...nope.<n>i didn't look at her face to see a reaction because i was scrambling to find the original picture, but i know she got a good look at how great my

 i think this movie is fucking hilarious and overwrought and generally pretty great.<n>i think this combined with the elevated heart rate associated with fooling around led to the following: getting up and immediately falling into a sweaty fetal position ball of severe head pain, vomiting profusely for an hour straight and ending up in emergency neurosurgery the next day to fix a burst aneurysm/subarachnoid hemmorhage.
 i have chronic insomnia, and sometimes, like this time, it gets **really** bad .<n>i was listening to a relaxing cold play song while driving, and it got ruined .<n>i blacked out just as soon as the cold play song finished, and a song by august burns red started (a metal band) and the drumming instantly woke me up .

 my friend and I always joke around and usually it involves some pretty dark humour .<n>One day the priest asked if anyone wanted to pray to their loved ones .<n>One of the teachers raised her hand and said that her sister-in-law was just diagnosed with cancer .<n>My friend whispers into my ear with the coldest fucking voice \wrect\ and i fucking lose it .<n>After the long silence that felt like eternity the mass continues and i feel like i just slapped a baby with the side of a knife people turn around and say \lolfuehrer what the fucks wrong with
 I was in bed with a guy I've had my eye on for a while .<n>He crawls up the bed on top of me and crawls up the bed on top of me .<n>I'm covered in shit and i can't deal with life never mind you .<n>I'm a 26 year old women who would have bet money on the fact that she was completely in control of her bowels .
 An old friend and i get together for drinks, we met last year in a shared class and this was the first time we were reconnecting.<n> at the bar they had connect-4 and we decided to bet truth-or-dare to each rounds' winner.<n>my first dare was to take off my shirt and just wear my jacket, hers was to dance with me for 30 seconds when no one else was grooving to the live jazz band.<n>truths were asked: have you ever thought about fucking me? (i have), are you a dom or a sub? (she's a sub and wants
 one of those slider locks that move less than an eight of an inch to lock .<n>door was locked, but the lock was no good. in a quick flash, i had to hurry and slam the door shut.<n>after i was done, i looked at the lock, there was no hole for the pin to slide into.<n>the people who opened the door were probably just as embarrassed as i am, and i don't care if it was just this one location, i will try to avoid public restrooms for as long as i live.
 i moved into a friends from works apartment to split rent, well we're pretty good buddies.<n>well we hit it off pretty well and we've been talking for about a month or so.<n>well she came over to stay for the weekend when my roomate was out of town. had a great time, went to dinner where i had a few drinks.<n>we both fall asleep after going at it for a while happy and content.<n> woke up and immediately the first thing that comes to mind is the scene from blue mountian state where he wakes up with the older lady and \is that pee? oh
 my old phone (an iphone 5) had been through a lot and was finally reaching its last legs. it had spiderweb cracks on most of the face and the battery only lasted about 3 hours.<n>i planned on treating myself to a new phone, but it was only after i dropped my 5 in the tub that i decided to pull the trigger.<n>the coolest changes for me were the \3d touch\ and the fingerprint reader, and i wasted no time setting those up.
 she always messaged me, it was a bit off-putting actually.<n>we got a bit too cozy with each other, which was mostly my fault.<n>i didn't really like her that much but it had been a lonely few months, so i was willing to try.<n>i told her to stop messaging me, but that continued, so i blocked her.<n>i hoped that would end it but nope; instead she texts me, tells all our friends about it, tries to message me through them.
 i attended my boyfriend's boyfriend's boss's jewish wedding last night .<n>At one point my boyfriend left me alone, so i did what anyone else would do surrounded by a bunch of people they don't know: hop on reddit .<n>i read the article on the philosophy of killing baby hitler, which talks a little about how depriving the nazi party of such a charismatic leader could have been enough to nip wwii in the bud .
 i just unlocked my phone when i heard the changing room door open, thinking it was just another work mate .<n>i just got a snapchat from one of my friends so i go to reply completely forget my phone is on loud, so the camera sound goes off .<n>then i realise my manager certainly has no idea what snapchat is as he's in his late 40's and he probably just thought i took a picture of either a shit or my dick .

 our family went to the mall to do some shopping and i kept bugging them about wanting to go to a bookstore. eventually they gave up and we all went to the bookstore, since i was an annoying little prick back then.<n>Since they didn't want to stay there for very long, they kept on rushing me to just do whatever the hell i wanted to do and leave so they can continue shopping for clothes or whatever.<n>this is when i messed up. i somehow ended up at the calendar section of the bookstore (don't know why they have those) and i saw a spongebob calendar on the shelf.

 my housemate and myself have an inside joke whenever i send her money; typically i'll do celebrity names instead of my real name to make her statement look suspect.<n> this time i tried 'christopher walken' but the name was too long; instead went with the traditional 'celine dion'.<n> quickly ran up the bank to see if the payment could be stopped and explained the shenanigans; giggles were had but no dice once i hit the confirm button.
 when i was in elementary school, i met a group of 3 students that i quickly became friends with .<n>i was still awkward, and a bit odd. when i went to judas's house, there was nothing that my awkward self found normal besides option 3 .<n>i went to apologize to judas again but he would avoid contact with me .<n>i made new friends who were tolerant and understanding even after hearing the story .
 my girlfriend at the time and i went to this party a friend of mine was throwing. we drank a fair amount, not wasted but definitely drunk .<n>we decided to just go to bed after that as it was already pretty late and we were tired, but before i fell asleep another one of my friends poked his head in the door asking if he could sleep in the bed since there was nowhere else to sleep.<n>it was a pretty big bed and i knew the guy well and everyone was dressed so i let him sleep on one side, me in the middle, and exgf on the other. we both promptly fell

 my gf and i were playing the card game egyptian ratscrew. it's similar to war, but if two cards of the same face land, the quickest person to slap them wins the pile.<n>this was the first time my gf had played and was getting overly excited. she kept screaming each time we would go into slap (she kept losing). about 20 mins in there was a large knocking at my door. there are two Chicago cops, with guns drawn.<n>after i answered the door, one cop kept his gun raised up but the other cop points his gun at me. immediately they asked me
 so this actually happened a long time ago.<n>but not that i finally found a place to confess all of the times i've messed up, you will all be hearing from me a lot.<n>i already had plans for what i'd be doing home alone. oh yes, rubbing one out.<n>i got my dildo out from it's hiding spot and went to town for a good hour. let me just tell you, that this dildo isn't huge, but it isn't small, either. so anyway, i had the time of my life and ended up passing out in

 An hour ago, i woke in the middle of the night on my living room couch (around 11:00 p.m.)<n>i realized that i left my laptop turned on (it was sitting next to me), only to see that the last thing i was browsing was a porn site .<n>my brother however, saw this, and laughed himself to the bathroom .
 happened many, many (like 20) years ago but i am still emotionally scarred from it!<n>i was shopping at crate and barrel when i saw a large display of pepper grinders. they were all stacked up in a christmas tree fashion, stacked wider at the bottom and getting more and more narrow as they approached the top of the stack.<n>i was interested in looking at one of them, so i selected one from the middle of the stack, thinking that there was glass shelving holding each layer of grinders in place. there wasn't. when i grasped one about mid way up, the entire, and i do mean entire
 long story short, my wife freaked out after i did it, and punched me in the face and said we were getting a divorce, but she's on her period and never goes through with it anyway.
 A friend of mine was always sending me weird links on facebook that usually ended up being a really lame meme or one of those creepy youtube videos that may cause some serious psychological damage.<n>i get home from a movie night with the family and log onto facebook using my own personal laptop. the little pop noise sounded and i knew i had gotten a message from my dear friend.<n>i clicked on it and saw lemonparty.org linked up in the message for me.<n>it took a few minutes for the page to fully load and when it did, all i saw was old man porn.
 joe doesn't have a phone, he wanted to look a video up. instead of asking alice for her lg, he asked to use my phone.<n>i hate even giving my boyfriend my phone, because i have terrible selfies and accidental nudes (and on purpose nudes) on my phone. but i let him use it anyway. he looked up a youtube video, then looked through my gallery.

 my friend is still out of town, asked if i will go to her apartment and watch her dog for a couple days. sure no problem.<n>i connect to wifi, open a bottle of wine, call a few friends, and of course check the fridge for some food.<n>theres some frozen tart things that look good, so i preheat the oven to 400 and go back to drinking wine and chatting with friends. af ew minutes a go i hear these weird cracking noises coming from the kitche, so i go to investigate.<n>the smell immediately tells me that something is wrong, i open the ov
 I just got home from Christmas shopping and my sister is out watching a movie .<n>I thought to myself \what a great time to jerk off!\ so i got on my phone, and went to pornhub .<n>I quickly changed tabs on my phone so it looks like I was browsing facebook .
 as is tradition, my father comes into town around Christmas time and we go out to the bar where we met each other to have a few brews. (didn't know who my father was until i was 22. my mom's fault not his.) the bar had a beer i'd never tried, not your father's root beer, which tasted pretty much like root beer.<n>after our obligatory shot of whiskey (first drink we had when we met to break the ice of \so yea i'm your dad.) we ordered a few nyfrbs. well they went down a little to well
 my parents offered to have my girlfriend up for the holidays, so i took them up on it .<n>i was getting close to finishing, so i flipped her over to go off on her chest and... missed completely .<n>i decided to just risk it, close the lid, and make an \x\ out of toilet paper to divert my mother. it didn't. we woke up to the sound of a plunger going at it in the morning .
 Every year after stockings, all the dudes in the family take a picture with the underwear we got in our stockings.<n>i don't normally let my brother sit on my lap, but since at least 12 guys were packing onto a couch made for like 4 people, i let him so sit on my lap, at first i smelled something funny, but i just thought it was because i just didn't deodorize enough, so i just let it go.<n>well, after the picture, he gets off to go play with one of pur cousins, meanwhile i stay on the couch talking, and then i smell the smell again
 A cashier at a Walmart accidentally ate a grape from a register .<n>Her daughter asked if she could have a grape, so i say \i don't know, they aren't mine! ask her nicely if you can try one, too\<n>A manager of that particular Walmart happened to be checking out at the register behind me, heard me tell my daughter to ask if she could try one also, and started paying attention to what was going on at our register. he asked me if he could see my receipt for some code at the top and the time stamp, then asked for my name and contact information

 i thought my ass hurt before. the first shot of novocaine felt like someone stuck a lit road flare up my ass. but i got through it post op care instructions were to soak my ass twice a day, antibiotics, and naproxen.<n>the pharmacy wanted way too much for a sitz bath so i decided to find something cheaper.<n>at the dollar store i found a large plastic serving bowl. perfect!<n>the bowl that just that morning i sat my ass in, still weeping pus here and there.
 i had just gotten a haircut which leaves my sides and back of my head pretty short, yet i still have a lot of length on top.<n>my friends kept telling me I looked like a fuckboi, it kinda became the running joke.<n>i start flicking my tongue quickly at myself like a \fuckboi\, i think i'm pretty funny.
 i had to take some courses for work, and the way they set it up is that i pay for the course in advance and when i pass they reimburse me .<n>because the courses are industry specific, they charge a ridiculous amount for a 10 hour course ($800 + gst)<n>i'm going through the enrollment information for the course to see if there's any information on how long it should take .
 \nice aim, man\ thinking it was a normal compliment a girl was bending down to tie her shoe, with her butt in my face.<n>my friend started laughing, i was confused then he explained, i looked back instinctively to see if she heard.<n>i quickly turned around and finished my laps.<n>i never talked to this girl and avoided her for the rest of the year out of embarrassedment.

 i had just recently applied for a job at a local retail store and was hopefully going to be my first one. had a really successful interview and the guy seemed pretty keen.<n>because i was almost tripping and was being driven in the car, i somehow managed to mumble out the words that i'd call him when i got home to sort out the roster because they'd chosen to hire me. was both tripping and overly exited at this point.<n>30 minutes go by, then i get this crazy intense feeling of shit leaving my bowls at an alarming speed, so i rush to the bathroom to finally release this monster tur

 i ordered a package the other day and i asked my father if he could pick it up for me; he said sure.<n>He was on his way to the church, so it would be a while before he could bring it back to the house.<n>So here he is, opening a package everyone knows is sent to his son, me .<n>and what does he pull out? a 'glory cock ring' and 'fifty shades of grey' lubricant. and a butt plug.
 my boss, in short, hates everyone. he's a dick, just mean and super critical and verbally abusive etc, but it's otherwise a good job with good pay (self storage)<n>a couple weeks ago he had some procedure done and was given meds to take. he hasn't been in a whole lot since the procedure, mostly on the days i'm not in.<n>now i've been noticing over the last couple of weeks that our bathroom was being savaged by persons unknown.<n>i mean just shit splatters everywhere, and the rancid odor lasts for hours, even with air

 i don't carry cash, so i decided to take a hot chocolate packet since i figured the company owned me at least that much.<n> cue me in a washroom stall, consuming chocolate drink powder like some office worker doing drugs at the workplace because he's going through a middle-age crisis and his wife is leaving him.<n> turns out the hot chocolate powder was pouring out into my pocket the whole time, and melted due to body heat.
 i'm on holiday to lanzarote with my family. having been in the pool all day, the chlorine has my hair feeling a little bit like wet straw, so i decided i'd take a shower. seems pretty harmless, right? yeah, too. so i turned the shower on, locked the door behind me, hopped in the shower... all was well, until i went to wash my hair.<n> bam! enter monstrous hell-beast!!<n> not only was this thing sitting *on my shampoo*; it had it's web draped all over my conditioner. it even had the cheek to scuttle

 i burst out in full belly-laughing mid office and disrupted everyone .<n>i am now being written up for misuse of office equipment and getting a stern talking to about abusing work hours .
 i don't usually get snacks because they're really over priced and i don't need them, but that day i caved and decided to get some m&ms.<n>at the theatre where i'm from there is an m&ms dispenser and you fill a little container with whatever type of m&ms you want, but you can basically get double the amount of candy by filling the bottom of the container and the cap, quickly putting the two together, then opening it in your lap later.<n>while i was in the lineup to pay for the m&ms i realized that i

 i have never seen anything like this in my life .<n>The only thing that made the ride survivable were chocolate, biscuits, and large amounts of soda bought at the one place they stopped for a short break during the 7 hour trip and my fully charged phone to give me at least some enjoyment.<n>lucky for me, i also get the seat next to the toilet, anytime someone opens that toilet door you better not be breathing if you want to live, i did not dare to look inside but i kept praying the full 7 hours that i would not have to use the toilet during the ride, and if worse comes

 we were talking about how some of them were tiny and then my girlfriend says, \i'm tiny, too!\ my response was, \no you're not...\<n>i couldn't even get out the second half of my sentence (\... you have the biggest personality here!\) because of how badly i felt.<n> needless to say, i'm spending all day today making it up to her, bringing her flowers, and letting her know how much i love her and how sorry i was for such a stupid fuck-up.

 when i was 19 ish years old back in 2002ish i was living in a tiny house with 3 red headed women and another guy from my high school days.<n>i had my eye on one girl...she was a sorority girl, cute, flirty, great body and always laughed at my jokes.<n>this has to do with the unassuming quiet girl at the copy center. her name was \jane\ and she never really struck me as attractive like the preppy girl did.

 i moved into my apartment a little over a year and a half ago, not thinking to see if the place had air conditioning.<n>well, i quickly found out that it didn't and that my room would get hot as shit unless i had the blinds open for air flow.<n>i sleep in the buff when it's really hot and more importantly, my neighbors window is directly across from mine.<n>i ended up buying one of those cheap tapestries off of amazon to use as a blind that would still let air/some light through but provided cover.
 I've been texting this girl for a couple of weeks .<n>She's in college like 2 hours away but i know her through a mutual friend .<n>She's not the type of girl to want a \late night\ phone call .
 i overheard a co-worker saying the names of the server he was working on.<n> we use obscure names for our devices, and i swore i heard him say 08r2-anus.<n>i thought i'd get him to crack up since he was presenting to the group, obviously a big deal.
 i was coming up to Halloween and i asked my friend (lets call him rat) round cause we had been school mates and he knew i was bi and was call about it .<n>i kept dropping hints of what we talked about and he positively acknowledged them and didn't act on them which made me more confused .<n>as the evening went on i'd tried to make the odd \move\ which was like touching a leg or butt as a test to see if he actually wanted to do anything .<n>it was like sitting next to an open bag of rubbish i was feeling ill which is a massive

 i'm 18 now so this happened when i was 15. anyway, so i wasn't able to date at the time due to having strict asian parents.<n>i would almost never be able to go out, never. until one day i asked to go hang out with a homegirl. took me forever to persuade them to say yes.<n>i started to feel extremely sick and the room was spinning.<n>i told my boyfriend i was having a bad trip so he carried me to the room, laid me on the bed, and gave me a water bottle. he ran back out and grabbed the trash can, and

 pewdiepie made a video on photoshopping his girlfriend, and in my opinion, it was crossing lines. maybe his girlfriend marzia wouldn't mind, but photoshopping to that degree, i thought it did.<n>i wrote in the comments exactly this: \i'll be honest, that ain't very nice to marzia. no hate or anything, but if my boyfriend does that, i will definitely be upset\<n>i wasn't a fan of pewdiepie, but i am not a hater. however, apparently youtube viewers weren't particularly happy about my comment and decided that they

 i thought it would be hilarious to put the elf into our blender.<n>two hours later, my wife asked me to get out of bed as there was a weird noise coming from the kitchen.<n>i completely woke up as I found myself falling through darkness. instinct of course kicked in and i put out my left hand to stop myself falling.<n>my hand went straight through one of the large glass panes that was part of the door to the kitchen.<n>my forearm had smashed clean through the pane, but the outer edges were still jagged.<n>my doctor gave me a painkiller shot in my arm then proceeded to give me fourteen
 2 years ago, i was moving from an apartment in belmont to mountain view, ca - a small 10-15 mile journey .<n>i had very few belongings at the time so i called my trusty pick-up truck to bring his '94 red truck snug over to make the haul worse .<n>i sat - in slow motion - just watching this thing dance in the air with an onslaught of a busy pre-rush hour 65 mph traffic right behind it .<n> miraculously, it had landed at the *very end* of the \triangular\ section that separates the ramp to the lane .
 A few weeks ago, i had the lovely idea of taking my girlfriend out to a nice dinner after her shift at work.<n>i told her she could come to my house, shower, change, and we could be on our way.<n>i get a giant, fuzzy towel and fold it nicely by the shower; i make sure the shower is stocked with some nice ocean breeze shampoo and some pink frosted animal cracker soap (from my personal collection (; .
 i was building a new desk, and i decided that while i had everything dismantled, i should give the computer a good cleaning with the air compressor.<n>i start cleaning it, revving up the fan's to make sure all the dust gets out (again, normal) but this time, something's different.<n>I notice my led's come on for a second. \wait, did that actually just happen..?\ so i do it again.<n>\woah, that's so weird!\ and i continue to rev the fans, sending power surging through my motherboard, thinking nothing of it because it
 charles was commenting a shitload onto this one picture asking for this girl's number. i come along and tell her to stop leaving him hanging.<n>a few comments after this, he posts his number, openly on the widest of worldly webs, hoping she'll text him.<n>a friend comes along to take matters into his own hands. he saw the opportunity to fuck around, and took it, texting him \hey it's x!\ here comes the first warning, where the thought \he looks pretty dumb on his insta. i bet you he's autistic or something,\ comes up and gets
 my girlfriend tells me to come pick her up so we can grab lunch.<n>i get to her house and wait in the car for a few minutes (i'm not exactly her parents' favorite person, so i usually don't knock on her door or anything if i see their car)<n>it's like a hundred degrees in my car so i texted her: \i'm here. can i come in?\ \yeah sure. sure. i just have to talk to my advisor real quick then we can leave.\
 when i turned to the \nuevo\ section on the sub, my post wasn't there!<n>When i linked to my post on a different browser, it was marked as deleted.<n>i wasn't sure what exactly i did wrong, so went through the rules and thought that maybe i was breaking the \shower observations\ rule.<n>the bar of soap wasn't necessary for the showerthought, so i thought next, \hey, i'll re-word it so it's not referring to a bar of soap anymore!\ so then i do that, and lo and behold, my post gets

 i'm 19 and a pretty shy guy. so i matched with this girl. let's call her lily. she was cute and apparently 18 and a swimmer.<n>i felt awesome to come in and show that other guy to not drop plans with a girl, especially one that great. but then the shocker. she told me that her daughter is really 16 years old and that she's a compulsive liar.
 i stuck my dick in crazy* let's get some back story shall we? my x, was one of those. crazy, but attractive enough for me to say 'aw, fuck it, let's give it a try anyway.'<n>fast forward a few months and that crashed and burned like a plane over the bermuda triangle. now, i wasn't completely daft with this. she lives far enough away that i shouldn't run into her randomly in public.<n>i've run into her a few times before thanks to mutual friends and it's been..... a very exciting
 i moved to a city two hours away, but was visiting last week .<n>unfortunately, taylor was meeting up with his cousin so it was just brian and jay at the apartment .<n>brian had an almost empty bottle of vodka in the freezer, and doled out healthy doses to our open bottles .<n>it turned out the traces of ammonia in my corn salsa-ridden fudge shuttle had mixed with the bleach that was in the toilet to form chloramine .

 we just moved into a new apartment and there wasn't any furniture.<n>i had been saving up, and i thought it would be a big thank you gesture to him and he would be proud of me for being so responsible.<n>i got stuff i know he would like (because he doesn't care at all... even the condition of the furniture doesn't really matter)<n>i asked one of our friends to use his truck and he helped me move in while you were at work. well... he wasn't so understanding. he was extremely upset that there was a guy over when it was night.

 two days ago i went to a dealer in the town over and bought a used 2008 saturn astra xe for $4900 .<n>all signs pointed it to being a good deal: great consumer reports, clean carfax, checked out by mechanics, and it only had 68,000 miles .<n>a day later, i was driving it, and i noticed a rattling noise from under the hood .<n>took it to my mechanic, and he said that the a/c compressor was shot, and that i couldn't use it or i'd risk breaking my car .
 i saw this stuff called wonder wax, that is supposed to only stick to hair and not to your skin .<n>After you apply it, you're supposed to wait a minute for it to harden so you can easily peel it off .<n>15 minutes later it still won't harden and i'm starting to freak out.<n>my asshole is covered in purple satan goop and i have no way out.
 A few weeks ago my boyfriend decided to trust me with the password to his phone .<n>I decided to play with it a bit while he was asleep and wanted to see some of the pictures he had taken of us together .<n>I opened his gallery to find pictures and videos of him with other women .<n>During the first 3 months of our relationship he had been avidly flirting with multiple women .
